### Hello World!

Shubhankar Srivastava, an aspiring data scientist is currently living his days in the city of Bangalore. He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar is studying Computer Science in BITS Pilani, and hopes to make it big in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. He recently finished his summer internship in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, where he developed Automation Frameworks for god-knows-who! 

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past six months, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*.
