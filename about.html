## About

This blog is my accountability mirror, something i've maintained since 2016. Every weekend(almost), i `git push` a weekly report of my life covering my work, thoughts, relationships and a fitness log. This exercise helps me hit reset every weekend and get into Go mode!

Born and brought up in Bombay, i headed to Pilani to pursue Computer Science for my undergrad in 2013. Right after college, i worked at Myntra Data Sciences for about an year and figured i wanted to do more in life. Moved to Singapore and co-founded [Radicali](https://www.joinef.com/companies/radicali/), a regtech SaaS product for compliance teams -- ran this for about three years. In 2021, i moved back to Bengaluru and co-founded [Houseware](https://houseware.io) to build for the next generation of untouched creators!

i've been playing tennis since i was five, and won't miss an opportunity to get on the court. Since college, i've been running quite a bit with one full marathon under the belt. Off-late, i've been bitten by the JiuJitsu bug -- forever on that white belt, oss!
