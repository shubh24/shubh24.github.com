## About

Shubhankar Srivastava, soon-to-be startup founder at Entrepreneur First, has just finished off his one-year stint as a Junior Data Scientist. He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar did Computer Science from BITS Pilani, and is super-interested into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In the past two years he has worked at Myntra Designs, Belong.co, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Yrals Digitals, and loved every part of it!

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past couple years, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*. 

#### LEARN | DO | REPEAT -- He calls it life.
