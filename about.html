## About

Shubhankar Srivastava, Co-Founder & CTO at Houseware, building the command center for modern revenue teams. He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar did Computer Science from BITS Pilani('13-'17), and dived straight into Machine Learning & AI thereafter. He's previously been Co-founder/CTO at Radicali, where he spent three years building a SaaS RegTech product for Compliance teams in Singapore. Prior to that, he has worked in the Data Science team at Myntra for an year, building algorithms to show you which dresses you like! 

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past five years, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*. 

#### LEARN | DO | REPEAT -- He calls it life.
