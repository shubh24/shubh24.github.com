## About

Shubhankar Srivastava, an aspiring data scientist recently finished off his last off-campus semester. He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar did Computer Science from BITS Pilani, and hopes to make it big in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. He's joining Myntra Data Sciences and is pretty excited for the opportunities that lie ahead! In the past two years he has interned at Belong.co, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Yrals Digitals, and he loved it!

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past year or so, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*. 

#### LEARN | DO | REPEAT -- He calls it life.
