He recently got placed in Myntra and is pretty excited for the opportunities that lie ahead! This summer, he did his internship in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, where he developed Automation Frameworks for god-knows-who! 

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past eight months, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*.
