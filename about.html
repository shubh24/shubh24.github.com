## About

Shubhankar Srivastava, an aspiring data scientist just finished off his last semester on campus. Will be interning for the next six months in Belong.co(Bangalore), and he's pretty excited! He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar did Computer Science from BITS Pilani, and hopes to make it big in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. He's looking out for jobs and is pretty excited for the opportunities that lie ahead! This summer, he did his internship in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, where he developed Automation Frameworks for god-knows-who! 

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past twelve months, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*. 

#### LEARN | DO | REPEAT -- He calls it life.
