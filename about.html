## About

Shubhankar Srivastava, Co-Founder & CTO at Radicali, is building the first digital assistant for compliance. He hails from the city of dreams, Bom..sorry Mumbai, and calls Pilani his second home(first?). 

Shubhankar did Computer Science from BITS Pilani('13-'17), and dived straight into Machine Learning & AI thereafter. He worked in the Data Science team at Myntra for an year, building algorithms to show you which dresses you like! Previously, he's interned at Belong.co, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Yrals Digitals, and loved every part of it :)

Shubhankar loves to play Lawn Tennis, and wouldn't miss an opportunity to get on the court. For the past couple years, he has tried to keep himself on a regular running schedule. Circumstances conspire against him, but he finds his way somehow. 

Welcome to *Shubhankar's blog*. 

#### LEARN | DO | REPEAT -- He calls it life.
