`Life is no Nintendo Game - Eminem` 

We have been putting in disciplined efforts on building out the crux of our MVP - Gyani has been pushing forward on the backend while i manage NLP & Frontend. Rewrote a major part of our NLP engine to accommodate for a revamped UX & backend design. Pull requests everyday :)

I took the lead on our frontend efforts, building out a basic 3-page dashboard. Getting better at Javascript, but more importantly, getting better at CSS :p

My co-founder and i have divided our areas of work pretty clearly, and it feels like a good machine in motion. I focus on Product, leaving out Customer Dev & Sales on his plate. We have been discussing about company culture & hiring recently, tough questions to answer in the coming few months. Good questions to have :)

I took rest for the first three days of the week, out because of my groin injury. Went to a doctor, who told me everything's fine. Somehow, that wound a beautiful Placebo spell on my mind -- the pain vanished as soon as i came out of the hospital. Have put in 3 runs and one workout since, i am just astonished with the power of our minds.

Put in one scared(that i might break my bones) interval run, a couple recovery runs and a "Back & Biceps" Workout to get back into action. Time off the running tracks made me appreciate the fact of how lucky i am to enjoy my running. Makes me conscious of how i want to maintain this a lifelong passion. 

Spent a night playing poker at a friend's birthday party, and that was the summation of my social activities this week XD Should get better at it! Later lah :)
