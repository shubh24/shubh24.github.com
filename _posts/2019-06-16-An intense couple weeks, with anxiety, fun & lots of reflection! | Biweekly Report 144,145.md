Welcome to another edition of my biweekly reports! #144 #145

The last couple weeks have been really fun & stressful, but more importantly, fulfilling! We rolled out our new UI, and had to really push through our feature development pace. The last weekend was spent in testing out the integrations, and making sure everything worked as expected. 

These weekly reports require a fair amount of downtime to reflect about the last seven-fifteen days, which i didn't manage to sneak in last weekend. Hence, the biweekly report today. 

The last week brought along a fair amount of anxiety(and trouble in sleeping!), but debugging and fixing stuff made it a lot of fun! One thing i've realized that i enjoy is moving across different components of our tech stack multiple times a day - firefighting constantly. As Naval Ravikant says, specialization is for insects.

Talking about Naval, i have been consumed by his philosophy towards life since listening to his interview on the Joe Rogan Experience. i'm now listening to his mega-episode on "How to get rich", and it has made me reflect quite a bit on myself. i've been a lot about virtue signalling, something i'm very complicit in -- only to realize how stupid it is. i really want to figure out peace in life, but then that intent actually goes back to signalling - it doesn't seem to be a straightforward journey!

On the fitness front, i'm proud to say that i recovered from my runners knee, or have i? i put in two runs this week and feel positive, but after yesterday's 10K, i realized it's not back to 100% yet! i'll be taking it slow over the next couple weeks and foam-roll back to the starting line :) 

i have been swimming instead of running, and have seen visible improvements in my technique & stamina - and feel confident about integrating it into my weekly routine. Put in 11 out of 12 workouts/runs over the last two weeks -- bummed about skipping the Chest workout this Tuesday. Gotta get back on line.

Oh, India's playing Pakistan in the World Cup today -- some much-needed downtime and socializing for the weekend haha! Keep hammerin'
