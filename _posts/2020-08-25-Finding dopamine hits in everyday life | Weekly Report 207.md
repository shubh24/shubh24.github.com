Welcome to 207. Penning this down on a late Monday night, well it's almost Tuesday morning.

i've been on a funny sleep schedule hitting the bed at 5 or 5:30 in the AM and getting up in 4 hours. we have a customer onboarding this week and had to rush towards the release, although it was managed much better than earlier attempts. It was an implementation heavy week, where i didn't have enough bandwidth to think product or strategy. i've started with a daily product standup which helps us stay on top of prioritization of features and bugs.

i've been noticing that i get mini-dopamine hits in my daily work routine. For example, pushing to master deploy, merging big merge requests, seeing slack notifications of completed CI jobs. i get addicted to shiny little buttons.

We've been working out our distribution strategy recently, and one platitude that i heard from one of our investors recently has been ringing in my head repeatedly.

*revenue is revenue is revenue*

Lots to experiment, lots to do.

We've moved to a completely remote setup in Singapore itself, doing away with the office & furniture. Now my home office looks more like a gaming den with two external monitors and one big speaker. i feel proud every time i look at my table.

i broke my nofap streak after completing 49 days, and am now back on the streak. My brain has made the shift - Earlier, it used to be a compulsive urge but is now an unnecessary chore. Not focusing too much on this recently, cruise control is on.

On the fitness front, i put in 4 runs, 2 gym workouts and one foam-roll session. Skipped the Friday bicep workout because and made it up with an extra run on Thursday instead. i got myself a new pair of Asics this weekend, switching from Cumulus to Nimbus after two years. i get excited with new shoes :)

This weekend was heavy on work, but also well-rested with some Ganpati festivitiesÂ at my uncle's and some night hangs with my flatmates on Saturday. Big week this one, keep hammerin'
