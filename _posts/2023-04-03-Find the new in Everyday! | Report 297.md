Welcome to 297, a two-week report from April!

Work's been fun as we executed on a new usecase for the customer, and rolled out a v1 recently. Days had been packed, and urgency has been high. Realized that i need to get better at knowing when to go knee-deep vs when to stay hands-off -- there's opportunity costs in every decision. The new quarter is a good time to take stock, and plan ahead. Been learning about the developments in AI as well, and just like everyone, building a long-term view of what this could mean for startups, enterprises, developers and the whole wide world. 

Heard the phrase "find the new in everyday" recently - and that stuck. i think this is the way to grow, the way to maintain routine and still live with wonder.

i've been very happy with the sleep routine, automatic wake-up triggers to the brain are in place. This week, i put in 3 workouts, 2 runs, 1 tennis and 1 sauna session. i went over 67KGs for a couple days and then came back into the 66s range -- the calorie intake needs to grow with the weight. 

Visited Udaipur over the last weekend, amazed by the riches and sights that the town offers. Saw the City Palace, the James Bond famous villa, and spent good quality time with family over meals. Talking with Anukshi made me realize that building a family is also "building", creating something out of nothing, and in some ways, might be similar to what we do on a day-to-day basis at work. Good narrative to live by!

Skateboarded at Cubbon this Sunday, so much fun! Keep hammerin'
