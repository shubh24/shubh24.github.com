Last week was super-heavy on thinking about new ideas around our product -- we went through possible iterations to get maximum market penetration, and how to build the tech around it. We pitched the new ideas to a bunch of people, and got some good feedback -- however, advice is never wholesome & it is only us who can take the right decisions. Advice is overrated. 

It is easy to let go of the current goals while being smitten by new and exciting ideas, but important to stay grounded and execute. i had to take some hard decisions while defining the future of our product roadmap, and taking subsequent hiring decisions. A bunch of external factors like competition and fundraising always tend to loom over your head, but the only way to solve those problems is execution.

i spent a majority of the last week rewriting certain modules of our backend to improve the overall engineering, and make our front-end seamless. We've also started to measure our algorithm's accuracies, and will be taking decisions to improve the same. 

We put out this week's Early Twenties podcast with Dr. Shamoly Khera, our break into the Entertainment industry! Go listen :)

On the fitness front, i didn't feel great this week. On a couple days, i just crashed at 10 in the PM and slept for twelve hours, hence missing out on two workouts. i didn't let go on my runs though, even went on a slow two-hour early morning run over the weekend -- sunrises are so beautiful!

Anyways, gonna head out for my Monday run. Keep hammering!
