Welcome to Week 102. As i sit down and reflect on this week, it feels just like yesterday that i wrote the Week 101 blog! Where is my time going!

On Monday, i teamed up officially on the Dashboard, and ideated for a couple days. We finalized on B2B Sales as our problem domain, and have been refining the final product since then.

To validate our hypotheses, we have been reaching out to folks within our network and otherwise. We have conducted around 10 customer interviews in the last 4 days, and also pitched our idea to the EF cohort on Friday. Pitching is a good experience, it tells you a lot about a person!

We are slowly becoming Sales experts, understanding a problem domain from the inside out drills in customer empathy. If you're reading this & know someone in your network that does B2B sales, please connect us :)

Had no time to edit this week's vlog, will try taking out a couple hours next weekend.

On Thursday, we put in 3 meetings in the day and watched Singapore's National Day celebrations over the Esplanade -- The Asian version of the 4th of July! Saw supersonic jets fly above me, and fireworks light up the skyline. Also saw Singapore's AirShow over the Marina Barrage this weekend, it was superfun :)

I put in 4 short runs this week, but no workouts. Scheduling my day around the morning run/gym has been a pain in the ass for quite a time. I need to prioritize this! Have been making efforts to get back on a Fruit & heavy breakfast diet, gotta see it through!

I haven't been keeping up my habit of meditation & journalling, all a product of a bad morning routine. This will change soon.

Ok later la! Byes.
