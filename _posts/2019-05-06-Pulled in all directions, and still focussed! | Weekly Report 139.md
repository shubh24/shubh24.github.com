One Three Nine. Welcome!

It is funny how you can be pulled into four different directions, and still maintain sanity working on what is supposed to be worked on. Sometimes you get that little question in your head, whether this is worth it and you could have it so much easier. i read somewhere last week, that the grass is green on both sides -- focus on your green. Just another way of telling you to be mindful of what you're doing!

On the development front, we pushed forward on the existing backend automation efforts, while also making incremental changes to our frontend. We hired two freelancers from Upwork, with an effort to redesign our landing page & rewriting our frontend codebase to ReactJS -- with a much better look & feel! 

We also worked on our hiring process, and put out the job descriptions for our initial hires -- excited for what's to come!

There was a public holiday for Labor Day bang in the middle of the week -- working on holidays gives me a weird kind of pleasure. Also sneaked in a super-productive Saturday at office, empty office chairs are beautiful :p

Since it is May already, a quick recap of the last month -- i put in 23 Headspace days, and 12 journal days, and also finished Harari's Sapiens! Not really happy with my journal frequency, to be honest. Something i'll need to pump my will power over the rest of this month.

i got back to losing at Poker this Friday, as a bunch of us caught up for a quick get-together. I took the majority of this Sunday to myself, working only for a couple hours in the evening. To make things crazy, i got up in the morning and went out for a 10K!

We released the 20th episode of the Early Twenties podcast, with digital nomads Gaurav & Andy as our guests. Go listen!

i am starting an experiment on Twitter, to put out exactly one tweet a day! The objective is to have a reflection of my day, and condense the major learnings into 280 characters on a consistent basis. Excited to see where this leads me! Follow [me](https://twitter.com/__shubhankar)!

On the fitness front, i put in two runs and three workouts -- i really had to make an effort to sneak in my night workouts in the schedule! Over April, i have missed one run/workout every week -- which makes 4 missed sessions. Not super-happy about that, i'll be tracking this metric over the next couple of months too. 

Enough, gotta get back to work. Cheers!
