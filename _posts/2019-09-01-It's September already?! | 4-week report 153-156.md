Welcome, boys & girls, ladies & germs!

This week marks Week 156(= Year #3) since I started this small little blogging experiment - well, it's ironic that i haven't put out a weekly blog in the last four weeks. It's easy to be disappointed for the lack of blogs in August, but i also recognize that it's one of those rare habits i've kept up for a long time now - and it calls for a pat on the back :)

The last two weeks have been so execution-heavy, and really satisfying ones at that. We are slowly building a structure to how we manage remote work, and it has seriously impacted my anxiety levels. There's still times where i get overwhelmed with all the work, but i've learnt to deal with it better. We also got our own office space in Telok Ayer - that has been pretty helpful psychologically.

In mid-August, i flew down to India - and went on quite a trip! Spent one and a half days in Dehradun for a friend's engagement, and then spent the weekend at home in Bombay. i put in a morning run on the 15th of August along the dusty village roads of Dehradun - reminded me of Pilani. Spending time with friends and family made me realize i'm growing old, and have started valuing those things more. Perspective hits like a fucking rock in the head.

i realized that i like being completley absorbed wherever i am. Over the weekend at home, i completely forgot about worklife. And when i landed back in Singapore, i got consumed by work. Don't know where this ramble is going, but i figured i like two things in life - work & family. It's probably the same for everyone, because it is what gives purpose to a human being - and everybody is in search of meaning & purpose. Tim Ferris said, "People find purpose by finding God, or by having children. Having children is easier". 

i have been thinking quite a bit about purpose lately. On my whiteboard, i have a long curly line across the length, where i'm always marked on the starting point. And the end point is marked undefined as "Where i wanna be". For quite a while, it has been labelled as "work for yourself" - which is quite a broad statement. i don't particularly like the concept of 'retirement', because i love the idea of 'adversity'. On the other hand, i envision one of the middle points as financial indpendence -- which means i need to pursue adversity even after i'm financially independent. Quite the puzzle.

Okay, i have gone way off track.

i bought a GoPro Hero 7 Black on my trip - i have been recording my gym sessions, and doing some private documentation of my days on the camera. It's such a fun toy to play with. Vlog sometime soon, hopefully!

This month has been a wild see-saw in terms of my daily habits - i have successfully managed to shift my sleep schedule to the mornings. 8AM mornings are now the norm, and so are morning meditations. Journalling has taken the hit as a consequence, and so did my workout schedule(for a week). However, i'm back on track now. In summary, i put in 19 meditation days, 6 Journal days, only 16/24 runs/workouts. Monthly mileage at 58kilometers, one of the better months post-injury :)

Oh, i also went to the Singapore national day celebrations along the Esplanade - it's become quite the bore now. Not as exciting second time around! We visited Coney Island with a bunch of friends, and we biked along the whole route - started from the West Entrance, crossed into the East and came back through Punggol. It was a lot of fun, as i rode crazy with my GoPro vlogging the roads. We also did a couple of late Friday nights in Tanjong Pagar & Clarke Quay, boy this place is crazy when it comes to nightlife!

Okay big week coming up, enough reflection. Lots to do, keep hammerin'
