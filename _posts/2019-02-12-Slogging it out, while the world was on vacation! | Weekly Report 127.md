Welcome, boys and girls, to #127 of my Weekly Report rollercoaster!

A lot happened over the last week, we moved into a new office space just next lane to our good ol' friend - Entrepreneur First! People took a couple days to usher in the Chinese New Year, while i worked my ass off :)

Mark Zuckerberg once said that Done is better than Perfect. I try to embody that quote in my everyday decisions, but then i begin questioning the threshold i'm setting for "Done". Done can't be an excuse for shitty. We shippped our product for our first paid pilot earlier today, and it feels relieving to say the least.

I got a working version up last Friday, but figured there was still a lot to be done! So i went back and put in two serious days in front of the screen. Deployed a bunch of stuff, reimagined our algorithms, and got us running six hours before the launch of the pilot. I believe in having deadlines. If i'd set April as the deadline, it would've been the same scenario. Done is better than perfect. It'll never be perfect.

Sometimes it feels like the world is closing down inside your head. Important to have a glass of water, watch some Casey Neistat, and execute.

Over the weekend, we recorded Episode #8 of the Early Twenties podcast -- where we talked about travelling, and other fun stuff. This episode almost didn't make it because of the busy wild time-zoned schedules, but we made it happen :)

It wasn't work all the week. We did a small get-together in my building over the Chinese New Year and watched "[Hush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(2016_film))", probably the first movie i've seen in more than a year! I also did a Poker night this Friday, lost ten dollars :/

Got all my workouts in, proud! It's becoming increasingly tough to accommodate time for these workout schedules in the evening, but it's something non-excusable in my routine. I go on a crazy guilt trip when i miss a workout, that's a great sign. Loving the process.

Also, Sodhi started his weekly blog reports this year. Impressed by the quality of these reports, something i should think about too. Check out his latest [blog](https://sodhi.xyz/2019-02-04-weekly-report-6/), it's insane!

Okay folks, until next time!
