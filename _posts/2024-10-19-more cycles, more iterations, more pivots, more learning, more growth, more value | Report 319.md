Welcome to 319, a two-week report for the first half of October!

i can totally see what Scott Belsky means by "more cycles". Using Cursor is a total gamechanger, i feel 3-4X faster with this UX. But the thing to note here is that it's not just your implementation cycles that increase, but broadly your idea cycles that go 10X. As the Groq stickers say, "think twice, code once".

Work's been rather fun, always something new that i'm learning with every day. Back in flow from the Bangalore office - didn't face any jetlag whatsoever and hit the ground running immediately from the day i landed. Also carved out some time to build some AI projects on the side, will be doing its product release in a month or so! Weekends were spent well, met a bunch of friends around the city, decompressed well, life's good!

Went ham at the gym, 10 sessions in the last 14 days. Rent is due everyday, and i make sure rent is paid. Feeling and looking strong, need to keep the tempo up despite travels. Weight's hovering around 70KGs now.

Keep hammerin'
