Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times.

Had a standard workweek spent planning out the implementation for a few features. Wasn't stressed too hard and for some reason, that feels like sub-optimal. Is it good for my growth to constantly stress and push to the edge? 

Our team has settled to a completely remote setup and we're now trying to make the most of this downtime. i crave for routine in life, and have come up with one to keep myself productive in the home office. The day starts with Trello & code reviews in the morning, followed with a couple standups, lunch and then 4-5 hours of research and planning. Haven't been coding myself for a couple weeks now. I try to break by 6:30PM, so that i catch the sunset on my run/workout - this is very important as i can get sucked in work and only get up at dinner time.

On the fitness front, i've put in 2 short runs & 3 bodyweight workouts this week - gonna get out for a run post pushing this blog out! Got myself a foam roller for home, and spent 45 excruciating minutes on it this Saturday morning - so worth it :)

i'd broke my Nokia last weekend, beyond hope. Got myself a OnePlus on Monday - feels good. Hope this one lasts. 

Last Sunday, i'd gone out with my journalling notebook to the canals to pen down some thoughts looking back at the last quarter. Need to have these health checks constant in the routine. Singapore's going in lockdown mode for a month now, so spent this weekend doing stockup, made myself some basic Indian lunch to prepare for the apocalypse and consumed more corona content. My head's been aching for a while, got my eyes checked as well - not sure what's wrong. 

A healthy man has a thousand desires, a sick man has only one.

Keep hammerin'
