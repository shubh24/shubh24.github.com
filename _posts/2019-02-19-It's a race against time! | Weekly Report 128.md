Welcome to Week #128 -- another one in the books! Assuming i live 80 years, i have documented just about 3% of my life on this blog. Just reminds you of the transience of time.

We rolled out our pilots for two clients, and got some really good feedback on our product. This will help us shape the product roadmap in a much more defined manner. i'm currently juggling our own system architecture issues with building out the feature requests by the customers, prioritization is key! 

I interviewed and hired a front-end intern late last week, excited to ramp up the speed of development on our UX. We have been intense on our fundraising process as well, there are no breaks whatsoever! 

It's a race against time. Or, as Caterina Fake says, it's a race against the bank balance. 

I watched the much awaited "Gully Boy" in the theatres. i might have been more excited than 5-year old kids, as i jumped in my seat singing along with the raps. So much fun, felt kinda weird to switch off from work for 3 hours. i'm not used to this kind of off-time!

Over the weekend, i pulled out my old journals from 2016 and 2017. Was going through my college day entries, felt quite nostalgic. It wouldn't be wrong to say that journalling might be the best habit i have cultivated over the past 3 years. That being said, i only put in one journal entry last week. i know, hypocrisy is my strong suit.

Over the weekend, we recorded two episodes for the [@earlytwentiespodcast](https://www.instagram.com/earlytwentiespodcast/)! We have released one where we talk about our work lives, and how we navigated the shift from college to corporate. Quite an interesting episode, go listen :)

My sleep schedule hasn't been great off-late. i am writing this blog at 3:37 AM on a Tuesday and have an 11AM meeting to attend. With the constant workload, it has been difficult to reset and restart. Book reading has also taken a hit, i might have put in only one morning where i made progress on "The Art of Thinking Clearly". 

A positive: all runs and workouts accomplished. Even after taking an unintended rest day because of Gully Boy, i made it up by giving off my weekend rest day. The diet is not great, so workouts might not be reaching their full potential. It all comes down to building a good sleep routine, which informs my diet and workout schedules. 

i should sleep soon. 

zzz.
