Welcome to 202.

A mixed week at work, where i couldn't really put in long hours of deep work. On many days, i'm shuttling in and out of video calls, while the weekend gave me some time to focus on solitary coding. 

i'm currently on Day 17 of my first attempt at nofap, and there is so much i'm learning about myself. There's too much residual energy, and workouts/runs have become a necessity now. It's bringing a few unproductive stretches in my routine, but on other days, i'm running through intense hours of flow. My wake-up times have improved - i don't need alarm clocks anymore functioning well on 6 hours of sleep. One very weird thing i noticed is that i'm noticing more colors in everyday life - i'm looking up more.

Have been struggling a bit to control the urges, but i'm trying baths, meditation, tried reading Marcus Aurelius to stay on the path. The brain is naturally resorting to other places for the dopamine hit, and i'm talking to a lot more people now. 

The more i continue on this journey, the more i'm reminded of Naval's one-liner - "Life is a single player game". i had started to doubt this when we were going through covid, but on the other side of the arc, i feel it truer. Talking about Naval, i heard his episode on "Innovation" with Matt Ridley, and that got me thinking about the next hot industry that i should be learning about. 

On the fitness front, i skipped Wednesday's run, but made it up by cancelling my rest day on the weekend. Rest days won't be necessary anymore, i feel. The arms & leg workout was completed at home over NTC, but happy i got them in anyway. The nights have been extending a little late with dinner happening at 11:30 PM or so. 

Very happy with how the weekend panned out. Took some time out to rest, but also put in contiguous hours on Sunday for work. i need to get better at taking out time for my growth as well. My meals are now split halfway b/w lunches at Jaggi's and dinners at home. Made myself some nice chicken breast this Saturday :)

Need to get in my Monday run now. Keep hammerin'
