Another biweekly report on the blog, i'll make sure this doesn't become a pattern!

I don't have very good recall on the past fourteen days, but will try my best. We rolled out a few features on the platform, and then planned out the roadmap for the next month or so. We realized we needed to make the roadmap much more structured & will be working on it in the coming week.

The last couple weeks have been fairly positive in terms of our hiring efforts, and also in terms of figuring out a long-term strategy. Can't share more, but a lot of it was interviews, reference checks & more interviews!

In the midst of all the action, we also put out our new website live [now](www.meetmica.io)!

We crossed June recently, so a few statistics: i put in 20 meditation days & 17 journal days, going strong! Missed two workouts in the whole month, but pretty happy with the recovery from runners knee. Last week has been good on the fitness front as well, i even ran an afternoon 7K with my brand new hydration vest & compression sleeves! i become an excited young boy with new gear :)

Recently, the weekends have been fairly slow & easy-going. My body has been asking me to refrain from screens, and its good to do that once in a while. Thanks to no-screen, i finished 'Good to Great' by Jim Collins this weekend! And we also recorded the first episode of Season 2 for the Early Twenties Podcast. Stay tuned :)
