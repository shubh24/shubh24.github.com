Welcome to a two-week report for #204 & #205

It was an intense couple weeks at work, as we teed up for a product demo in a regtech/suptech competition. i've reverted back to the 3AM routine, and even pulled in an all-nighter this Tuesday. It is fascinating to observe the inner talk that i go through while pulling in these 24 hour days. i had planned to slot two hours in the morning for independent work, but that has fallen by the wayside. Realistically speaking, we're looking at a longer wfh stint in Singapore and i need to invest more in upgrading my work setup at home. We met at office yesterday and i put in a solid 10-hour workday, felt more productive than i have in the whole of last month. We were greeted with some good news as we featured in an EY report on the Top 21 regtech providers in our vertical - some recognition but there's still a long way to go. 

i've been learning more about the spiritual meaning of life force energy(Prana/Chi), and how we can productively channel our energies in the right directions. i had restarted meditation(14 days in July) and cold showers as support systems when i started my nofap journey, and they've been quite helpful in setting my mornings straight. i'm currently running 36 days strong on nofap - been performing some exercises suggested by the Tao teacher Mantak Chia, and hence i'm not exactly on the nofap streak but rather on the 'semen retention' streak. i've stayed away from porn the whole while. 

Because of nofap, i've noticed the cravings for dopamine that the body asks for, trying to find it in other places online. i've been more active on the dating apps talking to women, which i feel is a step in the positive direction. However, this can get out of control and i need to find a long-term solution of keeping my dopamine fixes in check. i remember the day i pulled in the all-nighter that i had no energy or bandwidth of thinking about my urges, which tells me that physical/mental exhaustion is the way out. Talking with people in real life is highly underrated, it's very easy to stay on the path on weekends when i'm out with friends.

i missed the blog report last weekend, which is not good. Need to stay consistent with this habit. Writing this particular report on a Saturday gives me a lot more downtime to think deeply about these reports and not rush through them. The last few weekends have been well-structured & restorative with meetups, tennis sessions, grocery shopping, sleep and cooking chicken :)

On the fitness front, i've missed out on a few gym sessions over the last few weeks and a missed long run last weekend as well. However, the tennis sessions have more than made up for the soreness. i reverted to evening runs after just one week of morning runs, will try to switch back.

I've been consuming podcasts as usual, focusing on JRE. Listened to a few episodes from a16z & London Real recently. On YouTube, i've been watching videos about nofap & quite a bit of crap put out by pickup artists. Listening to @badboyshah's latest album and i'm a fan. 

Rakshabandhan was fun, met up/video called with cousins and family. i've been talking with family for close to one hour every night, which is a very good thing. It's probably one of those things that i don't view as a time/money investment that will yield something and feel good after doing it. It's Bitsians day weekend, was going through my photo gallery this morning. It's weird & funny how life changes.

Keep hammerin'
