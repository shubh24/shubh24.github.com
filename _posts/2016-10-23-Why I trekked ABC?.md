`16th October 03:00, Machapuchchre Base Camp(3170 metres)`

It's freezing cold as I wake up to the Himalayan ranges towering above me, in the backdrop of a pitch-black starry sky! Today is the day we catch the sunrise at ABC, still a two-hour trek from here. I inspect the lighting on our route and find no sign of human life on it, delaying our start-time from 03:30 to 04:00. Going back to my cot, I replay mental images of reaching ABC one last time, zoning into Wiz Khalifa playing in my ears. 

`03:50, Machapuchchre Base Camp`

As excited as a 5-year old, I'm all set to trek! I spit on my palms, and sprint a couple of 30 metre stretches to warm up. Gyani's done the customary vlog for the beginnning of the day -- we trek 400 metres to ABC, soak in the mountains and then begin our 2000 metre descent to Bamboo, all within 12 hours. 

Man, it's gonna be a long day!   

`04:20, On the ABC Trail`

We've been going at a fairly good pace so far, with just a short break in between. The full moon peeking from above the Annapurna seems like our lone friend through the dark trek, guiding us along. A brazilian trekker has crossed us so far, as we look behind to find a few trek camps with headlamps following the trail. Doing pretty good!

`04:30` 

I feel a little light in the head, and stop for a break. We hadn't carried our backpacks or water to avoid overhead, a big mistake. The altitude is getting real!

`04:35`

I'm actually feeling dizzy, as I stumble on a couple of rocks, taking another break. I push my head backwards, angry and helpless at this situation, my will power leaving me for a few moments. A few trekking groups pass by, encouraging us to take some more rest and move slowly. 


Our Polish friends whom we'd met earlier, recognize us and give me some water, caffeine tablets and a couple of Oreo cakes. Lifesavers! I pop in a Diamox with the water which I believe to be liquid oxygen. I genuinely mistake the water for oxygen, and the Placebo kicks in immediately! Getting back up, I feel better -- but this time, I take it slow.

`05:30, The Base Camp is visible!`

"It's all in the mind", I repeat in my head! Putting one foot in front of another, baby steps. At this stage, I'm trying to minimize the breaks we take to maintain our rhthym. 

The Base Camp, the huts with the constant lights, look so much within our reach, and after every turn they get even further! The Annapurna South, straight up in our faces, looks absolutely majestic, serving as my sole motivation to walk. some more stuff

`05:50, Almost there!`

At this stage, I can't even feel my face or fingers. The temperature had to be definitely in negative. Gyani and me both check each others' status regularly with minimal affirmatives, this was definitely the toughest stretch for me in the whole trek so far!

`06:04, We made it!`
