It is 22:55 on the 7th of October. 

Tomorrow, I write my midsem for "Professional Ethics" from 11:00 to 12:30, catch a bus to Loharu Station at 13:00, reach Delhi by 17:00, take a bus to Lucknow by 20:00, take another bus to Gorakhpur at 10:00 the day after, reach Gorakhpur by 15:00, take a cab/bus to Sunauli, cross the border to Nepal, and catch another bus to Pokhara! At least, that's the plan!

[@Gyani](https://www.facebook.com/iownfb) and me have been planning to visit Nepal for a long time now, and it is finally happening. We'll be doing the Annapurna Base Camp(ABC) Trek, which generally takes 8-10 days -- considering good fitness standards. The trek starts from Pokhara, the second biggest city in Nepal, which has a few adventure sport sites as well. A 1-2 day trip to Kathmandu is also planned, depending on how fast we trek ABC! 

The trek to Base Camp will definitely be tough for me, but this is just the beginning. Exhaustion will be fought, and Annapurna will be conquered -- that is, if everything goes our way. I've watched enough Youtube videos and read enough blogs, it is time to get there and climb!

We'll be vlogging and documenting the whole trip, stay tuned for a lot more travel blogs when I'm back!

Here, have a look at the pre-video. This plan is too vague!
