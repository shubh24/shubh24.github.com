Welcome to 183. i like this number - it's Dhoni's highest ODI score :)

Pretty standard week at work - i'm now thinking if i'm spending my time in the most efficient way possible. i'm giving it my all, balancing dev with planning, balancing internal with external - i need to be ruthless with myself and cut all unnecessary activities.

i was talking with my Mom recently and the conversation shifted towards the long term. i've been reading Meditations and thinking about stoic philosophy has made me start thinking about death much more than i used to. i've seen peculiar patterns in how old men live their lives, and wonder how our priorities change over time. Tim Urban's [Long Tail](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) hits hard everytime i read it. i should get some clarity about where i want to get to by the time i'm 30.

In other non-serious news, i bought myself a mechanical keyboard for work - it's gonna be fun transitioning from the terrible Butterfly keyboard. i've recently started learning card tricks from YouTube, it's always humbling to start learning from scratch. Have been looking to get into magic for a few months now, and a recent Tim Ferris episode with Richard Turner really led me towards picking up the cards! The goal is to start doing tricks in front of people within a month.

We released another episode of the Early Twenties podcast that we'd recorded last weekend - have a listen!

On the fitness front, this week was quite mediocre - put in 2 short runs and one workout. My poor time management is leading to late nights at the office, and thus missed workouts. i hit the gym after around 10 days, and could feel the loss of muscle(have lost a kilogram), i constantly need to be on the grind. 

This weekend was another well-spent one, where i ticked off a bunch of to-dos on Sunday, and took care of other things on Saturday. Met an old friend after about a year, and also did brunch with our SG team - good weekend.

Keep hammerin'
