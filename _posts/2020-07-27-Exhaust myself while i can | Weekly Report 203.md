Welcome to Report 203.

Writing this report on Monday evening post a fulfilling start to the week. The last week was good in terms of work output, as i tried to exhaust myself on a daily basis. 

At work, we started work on a new sprint after wrapping up the previous one. i'm getting a hang of managing the product roadmap better but i could get a lot better in terms of managing all pending user stories and balancing it with feature velocity and tech debt. Tried to break down the process of building our backend services into phases over a sprint's time so that frontend and backend can work together in an easier way. i'm working better through the afternoons, although i did experience crashes two out of the five weekdays.

i'm on Day 24 of nofap and i'm aiming to hit one full month before taking any further call. i've started to make this a part of my identity, trying to use the social identity to trick my brain. The benefits that i noticed in the first 10 days have not continued through but i'm still functioning at 6 hours of sleep feeling way better through the day. There are obvious times when urges arise and i'm probably not doing my best to handle them the right way - however, i've begun to see improvements in my will power and overall daily routine. i need to start documenting these thoughts on my private video diaries to look back on these days when i might feel weaker. 

i went out skateboarding on Monday after so long, and tried out a few basic tricks over some slopes. Followed it up with an easy recovery run, i'll be trying to sneak in one skate session every week from now. i've been meditating more regularly now, put in 5 Headspace sessions over the course of the week.

On Friday night, i met up with a bunch of friends for a poker+bollywood night. Had a lot of fun, lost my voice and came back at 4:30 in the AM. Wrapped up grocery shopping on Saturday, and also put in one-hour tennis session on Sunday morning. Ended the week with a strong 6 hour work chunk on Sunday night preparing for the week.

Need to cook my dinner now. Keep hammerin'
