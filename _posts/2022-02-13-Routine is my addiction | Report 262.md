Welcome to 262, a two-week report - it's February, and before i forget, Gong Xi Fa Cai! It's the year of the tiger, or was it the eye?

We moved to a dedicated cabin at WeWork and got monitors installed recently, the workspace is becoming a part of the routine now. Routine is somehow addictive, and i can't wait to go to sleep to go through it again - i've come to love the structure of my morning boot-up schedule. i worked on a bunch of different problems at work, and have been enjoying the challenges. We've tried to plan sprints with specific focus areas, and that helps look back at progress in a definitive way - helps in having good morale for the self and the team. In 0 to 1 setups, we define the race we run, when we rest and when we celebrate - and that's fun. 

i've been thinking about ideas recently. Jung said, "People don't have ideas; ideas have people". Many times, we are consumed by software programs running in our heads that we aren't even aware of. Fridman & Rogan talk about ideas being this abstract entity that  strike our consciousness out of nowhere -- and i've realized so many of our actions follow our ideas. i need to be conscious of what thoughts and software programs i expose my brain to, there seem to be a lot of malware out there sucking our time and energy. Talking of Rogan, i was very curious and followed the controversy surrounding the platform he gives to fringe scientific opinions. i might be biased, but nowadays i feel like mainstream science has started to feel like religious dogma of the middle ages. Sometimes i think that all of this is a distraction, and cancelling/platforming people does not really affect my individual life and i should stay away - but then, i come back to the point about ideas being the core of our Operating Systems. If we censor ideas, we're not allowing the next Galileo to come up with the controversial theory about earth not being the center of our universe. i'm not really sure if any of this matters, but if i had kids now, i'd be worried.

On the fitness front, i finished January with an aggregate of 50K on the runs. i've clocked 22K so far in Feb, and have been consistent with gym workouts and my stretching routine. i've been going to BJJ classes on Saturdays for sparring in Gi, and want to increase the frequency from this week onwards. Got a pull-up bar installed at home, the lats are loading. Got started with getting lunch packed for the office, need to get more regular at managing nutrition. Spent some time at Nature's Basket this Saturday, and doing groceries gives me unbounded joy.

i've been fairly social the last couple weeks, and that's a good thing! Met up with a few new folks introduced by the Singapore group, played some poker last weekend but realized i don't enjoy it as much anymore. i guess it's the people rather than the cards on the table. Went out with the team out for a dinner last Friday. Met up with V last Saturday after three frickin years, time's such a bitch. Earlier today morning, i went on a long run at Cubbon and then spent some time at a picnic playing frisbee and dodgeball, how long since i've done that! Met up with a couple women on first dates, looking forward to how things shape up - definitely forces me to be better at all aspects of life :))

keep hammerin'
