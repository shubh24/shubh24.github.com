###### If you're doing what everyone else is doing, you're doing it wrong. -- Casey Neistat

The primary objective of setting up this blog is to keep myself accountable to my goals. Also, I find myself starting things and then leaving them halfway. This blog will hopefully keep me in check of my done vs to-do lists.

Many a time, I find the list on my Evernote overwhelming! Many a time, I don't know where to begin with, switching back to doing stupid things. 

Putting things in perspective 

-  I have my summer internship going on which takes up a majority of my time during the weekdays. 
-  I'm sitting for placements within a month and that should be high on my priority! 
-  I intend to keep building side-projects, and keep learning new concepts in Computer Science/Software Dev.
-  My long-term goal for this year is getting within the *top 10%* of a Kaggle Competition. For that, I've decided to commit to *Two Kaggle Competitions per month*, and work on them seriously! 

I commit myself to **ONE BLOG EVERY WEEK**. This will hopefully get me working on some project or competition every week!

I also intend to write a very *FiveThirtyEight-ish* blog on data science challenges or projects that I take up in the future.

I hope I stick to my promises! That's it folks!
