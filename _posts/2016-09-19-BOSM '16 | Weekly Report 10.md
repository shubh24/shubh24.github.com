This morning, my team went down fighting for the Gold Medal, at BOSM 2016. It was a tough match against [LNIPE](http://www.lnipe.gov.in/), disappointed that our team couldn't match their athleticism and co-ordination. Nevertheless, a Silver is worth being celebrated -- it was a good tournament overall!

The current team looks very promising, the effort put in the last month clearly showed on the courts. At the end of the day, I feel that I should grow as a sportsman everytime I practice, and college sports fests are a great platform for us! I feel this BOSM was a lot better than previous editions, and it has been Pilani's fastest growing fest over the past 4 years.

The next goal is to run a half marathon by the end of this semester. Will have to begin training straightaway, with a proper diet and regular practice. I'll be going for a couple of 10K runs in Delhi, this October!

Earlier in the week, I spent over a day editing the Triund Trek Vlog. Go ahead, have a look!

Expect some drone footage in the coming weeks, [Syma X5SC 2](http://www.amazon.in/AZi-Syma-X5SC-Explorers-Quadcopter/dp/B0199X3L4A) is on its way to Pilani! 

That's it folks!
