Welcome to 327!

i almost vibe-blogged this report, but then decided it's one of those rituals in my life that shouldn't be taken over by LLMs. Cursor+Claude has gotten so darn good - having access to 300+ blogs over the last 7 years, it understands my writing style and life really really well!

Everything is accelerating, and it just drives the best out of me. It's fascinating how everyone is losing their minds over how good code editors/models have gotten, while at the same time, it's an early sign of how entire industries are going to go through this awakening. 

i've been attending a bunch of hackathons over the weekends, tinkering with 1-day projects like [this](https://x.com/__shubhankar/status/1894280895424860507) and [this](https://x.com/__shubhankar/status/1898641000157138981). However, i've realized that hackathons are imposing an artificial constraint on me and i'm not taking on larger projects in my head. i'm going big with my next adventure. 

Work at LaunchDarkly has been fun, as we've been focused on product integration; sprinting towards releasing Product Analytics to our customer base. The ex-Houseware team is now the LaunchDarkly Product Analytics team, and we're scaling! 

On the fitness front, i'm happy to share that i'm now regular with BJJ(3x a week), and also trying to keep up the 3x gym sessions. Training without a personal-trainer is definitely not good for the gains, because i subconsciously don't train as hard or take more breaks. i need to train harder. At JiuJitsu, i've been doing positional sparring, but had been avoiding sparring - but now that i have a bit more confidence, i plan to go all-in. Have been trying out delivered meals from MuscleMeals for the last couple weeks, but not super happy with the satiety, gonna switch it up soon to something different.

Keep hammerin'
