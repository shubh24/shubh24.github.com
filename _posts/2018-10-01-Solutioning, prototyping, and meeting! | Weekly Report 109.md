Welcome to Week 109 - another week heavy on solutioning, another week living on extreme sleep patterns. 

This week, we brainstormed harder on our Solution, trying to kill the idea over and over again. Refined our go-to-market basis a couple discussions -- had some really negative conversations, had some really good conversations! We have begun to show traction in terms of Letters of Intent, still a long way to go. 

Began testing out a couple hypotheses by building hacky prototypes around our MVP. We have a super-checkin at EF this week, a mock for the Investment Committee hurdle -- spent a couple days prepping for that.

The whole of EF Singapore community met together at a theatre to watch EF Europe's Demo Day -- came back inspired, ready to do more. We're slowly zeroing down on our product roadmap for the next 12 months or so, might get an intern onboard if we get through our first funding through. Over the weekend, we penned down the user flow, trying to come up with the script for another mockup video. Work in progress currently, but it should be up by midweek.

I took this Sunday a little easy compared to the rest of the week, caught up on the accumulated sleep debt. Practiced meditation and journalled over the weekend, it's such a good refresher! 

Ended September with a nice 10K along the Kallang riverside, put in a total of 125 kilometers over 30 days. My best month so far, i'm so so proud of myself. Even went for an early morning run this week for a change! Keeping it rolling, gotta keep it going.

Have been listening to quite a few podcasts nowadays, would like to jot down a couple of good ones -- Almost every pod with Reid Hoffman(Masters of Scale) is gold. I learn at least a couple points relevant to our startup from each episode. Tim Ferris, as usual is killing it with long-form content. Discovered Gretchen Rubbin's "Happier" pod -- good life-hacks snuck in there. "The Startup" by Gimlet Media is pretty dope -- listened to the episodes on Twitch's history. Worth mentioning, Nike Training is putting out good content on Nutrition, Mindset & Fitness -- might very well become my go-to channel soon!

Yeah, that's it for now, come back next week for more :)
