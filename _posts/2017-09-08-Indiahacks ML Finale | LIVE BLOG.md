**15:16** -- Getting in the flow, slowly. The data is up and ready, i'm still figuring out how i want to structure my dataframes. I'm reminded of a similar problem i'd taken up around a year back, around building hybrid recommender systems. Current plan of action is to build a workable pipeline, and then take all my feature engg. ideas from there. 

**14:37** -- I've had a look at the problem statement -- Recommending movies to users based on their previous viewing history on Hotstar. 2 mil rows in training, and a limited number of submissions -- add unclean data to the mix. This challenge is gonna be fun. Starting with cleaning the dataset.

**September 8th, 13:45** -- 15 minutes to start. I'm more hungry than excited, gotta grab some lunch!
