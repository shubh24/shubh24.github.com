**18:00** -- Onto my second cappucino within an hour. The 2 mil rows are giving me the hots :p Decided to go ahead with filtering the not-so-frequent users, for the sake of time and complexity, compromising on training data. Still building the pipeline for test data iteration. Looks like a couple submits by end of the hackathon would be a good result! Shouldn't be demotivated. Cmon fight!

**16:38** -- Frustrated. Switched from a user-user collaborative system to item-item. Should've figured this out earlier, given i have 2 mil users and 3K movies. Feel like i need a break, should hopeful for a submit in an hour or so. 

**15:16** -- Getting in the flow, slowly. The data is up and ready, i'm still figuring out how i want to structure my dataframes. I'm reminded of a similar problem i'd taken up around a year back, around building hybrid recommender systems. Current plan of action is to build a workable pipeline, and then take all my feature engg. ideas from there. 

**14:37** -- I've had a look at the problem statement -- Recommending movies to users based on their previous viewing history on Hotstar. 2 mil rows in training, and a limited number of submissions -- add unclean data to the mix. This challenge is gonna be fun. Starting with cleaning the dataset.

**September 8th, 13:45** -- 15 minutes to start. I'm more hungry than excited, gotta grab some lunch!
