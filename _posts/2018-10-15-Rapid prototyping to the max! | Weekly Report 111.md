Week 111: six and a half work days, six workout days, seven full days.  

Spent the initial part of this week planning & discussing the future roadmap. We were asked some tough questions on our go-to-market strategy, and whether we are sticky enough. 

I then devoted the majority of this week on execution, the result of which is live [here](http://demo.radicali.io)! It's an obligation engine built on two major regulations in data privacy, taking baby steps towards a functional prototype. I haven't executed(ever!) as fast as I have done on this prototype -- did everything from NLP parsing to text classification to building a backend! Loved how i went from idea to product from Monday to Sunday.

Also spent some time thinking about the lean startup methodology, and how we should be designing the product roadmap realistically. As Mike Tyson says, *"Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the face"*. 

Insecurity still creeps in, but my co-founder keeps reminding us that we're here to win, not to participate.

I (re)started the gym practice -- alternating runs with the gym sessions. Really went full throttle on my legs and chest this week, super happy with the efforts. Also put in a sweet little 11K this weekend along the Singapore river, these weekend runs have become a beautiful ritual :) Sunday is the worst day; i have to rest urgh.

I have been on a crazy streak meditating(Headspace) & journalling, running on 19 days as of today. Holy! Not really happy with the sleep routine, gotta shift it by a couple hours at least.

There are a bunch of meetings scheduled this week, looking forward to a productive one! I'm constantly thinking about features in the product, ideas for the MVP -- maintain this mental state. Forever.

Later.
