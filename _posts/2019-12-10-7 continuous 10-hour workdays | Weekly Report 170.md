Welcome guys, this is 170. 

These weekly recaps are so good for me, forces me to do a lookback every 7 days. Whoever came with the concept of a week was a genius - driving repetition through the infinite nature of time.

The last week went so fast, i was so engrossed in work that i tuned out everything else. We were due to launch a bunch of features today, which we did! 10-12 hour workdays have now become the norm, and i feel a little weird of thinking about leaving office after a usual 8-9 hour day. Not healthy for the long-term, but it's what it is. i do what it takes.

The funny thing is that i don't feel exhausted at all, in fact i'm raring to get back to work tomorrow morning. You know from within when you're doing what you love. As a side-effect of the last week, i didn't put in any fitness sessions & have been a couch potato the whole of last week. The first 3 days were expected as i was recovering from the full-marathon, but i shouldn't have carried forward the lethargy through the week. Looking forward to hit the gym tomorrow morning.

There were no meditation or journalling sessions the whole of last week. One thing that i observed within myself was when i saw myself in third person getting anxious about timelines, and that calmed me quite a bit. Meditation as a practice has definitely helped me look at life objectively. 

Overall, it was a good week where i was obsessed with the product at all times of the day - except when i was listening to Joe Rogan on my commutes. Boy, the whole Gamechangers debate is so spicy, i'm not listening to them for the debate anymore - the masala is so much fun!

Alright, later. Keep hammerin'
