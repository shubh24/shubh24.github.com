Welcome back, ladies & gents - it's been a minute!

This is much overdue, haven't sit down and took a breath in the whole of the last month. We've been working hard towards a product launch, amidst the Diwali festivities & all the air travel. Sometimes when i sit down and type this out, i feel like the luckiest man. Have been daydreaming inside my head for the last 30 minutes, just reflecting.

We launched a version of our product last Monday, and it was the culmination of long weeks. Proud of what we achieved in the last 6 weeks or so. We had a bunch of review meetings and figured out the areas we could improve on. Over the last week, we planned out the next couple months on the dev front.

i spen the last ten days with the team in Bengaluru. Felt inspired with how everything's shaping up. We took the last Friday evening off, and played a bunch of board games in Koramangala! This trip was a little less social than the September one, spent a few long nights in the office and didn't have the time to meet people. I left on Saturday, amidst the whole Ram Mandir curfew situation, was kinda scary at the outset but it didn't matter at the end. 

Before BLR, I spent 4 days at home in Bombay, celebrated Diwali & my sister's birthday! It wasn't a strict vacation, as we still did standups at 9:30 in the mornings pre-launch. Had a lot of fun playing Teen Patti with everyone on Diwali night, it's one of my favorite festival thingies. Sneaked in a couple runs & a chest workout, and also met up with a couple school friends - insane perspective hits when i go back home. Every. Single. Time.

Before the Bombay trip, spent a couple strong weeks in SG. Frankly don't remember a lot from the time except that i was cranking out the hours at work - that's been constant :) Put in a 3-hour run in preparation for the StanChart marathon, and put in a 6/6 workout week as well! 

On the fitness front, it's been quite the rollercoaster - Post the 6/6 week & good runs in Bombay, i went on a dry patch in Bengaluru. 9AM standups weren't really conducive to my morning runs - my night routine didn't help either. i didn't play any tennis this time, as i've been feeling some soreness in my right pec for the last week. Benched a little too much I suppose, recovering well though - fingers crossed for the marathon soon!

Haven't gone really strong on the meditation/journals for the last month, it's been patchy & all over the place. On the reading front, i started & finished Murakami's "What I talk about when I talk about running" in a flight - fun & relatable book! Have been thinking about the frequent India trips and the year gone by, already getting in December mood - will be charting out my end-of-year plans soon! Spent a large portion of this Sunday recovering on the bed before resuming war tomorrow. Keep hammerin'
