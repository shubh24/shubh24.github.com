Welcome to 322, writing this at 3:54AM on a Monday morning, back from Bangalore!

Sometimes i wonder if i should take some rest, and then i watch someone like Casey absolutely crushing. Drives the heck out of me!

Happy that i've been consistent on the blog for the last few weeks, starts off every week with a win. Work's been fun. i've realized that i have a unique skill of finding meaning and fun in whatever comes my way. Important skill, but important to recognize that what i choose to do has to lie within the intersection of fun, competence and progress. It is natural to get stuck at something that i might be good at and seems fun, but if it's not moving the 10-year vision for me, need to cut it out.

Heard Shreyas Doshi talk about "building taste" in one of his talks, and how it is a learnable trait. Game recognizes Game. Having the vision of figuring which founder is gonna win, which product is gonna drive engagement, which user flow is gonna evoke the human spirit -- something i need to get better at!

By the way, agi is coming soon. i prompted GPT with one of the recently-popular prompts: “Based on what you know about me. draw a picture of what you think my current life looks like”. Mind blown. i'm afraid the machines would soon know us better than any humans ever could. The only option is to merge.

Last few days have been a blur because of the long flight from SF to Bangalore. Pumped to be back, on-ground with the team, the latent energy in India is something else. i don't think i've talked about this on the blog, but a few months back we installed a PS5 in our office and i've been addicted to FIFA since. Video games are fun!

My 2024 fitness goals would likely not be hit, but i'm gonna push my hardest in the next 40 days with a good routine. Hovering at a bodyweight of 70KG, but i can feel that the muscles need to be engaged more. Will start the day with a gym sesh now.

Keep hammerin'
