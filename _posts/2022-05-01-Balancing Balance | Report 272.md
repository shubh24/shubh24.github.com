Welcome to 272, a two-week report after long!

Work's been fun and challenging these last couple weeks as the team worked towards a mini-release of the product. In the last week, i went out for a couple in-persoon meetings and also had a bunch of external calls mid-week. This week was much more heads-down focused on execution as we ended the sprint. Was listening to BJ Penn talk about his career, where he talks about how confidence is the antidote to anxiety: the internal story we tell ourselves seems very relevant for all pursuits. Both these weekends were fairly heavy on work, but i don't feel stressed as such. Currently thinking about how i can improve my interactions with people in real-time, and how anything/everything i think and say affects my/team's work output. 

Nadal talks about how playing at the elite level is actually detrimental to the athlete's overall fitness, given how gruelling it is. Feels like operating at the highest human performance at work/life is similar: i constantly have to break myself down and build myself up. At the same time, i should maintain balance despite its elusive nature. It's not possible to be balanced while going after outsized goals: and the way i try to go after this is by setting outsized goals across all dimensions of life -- which automatically balances them out. 

Over the previous week, i talked with a couple school friends after so long - weird how these relationships don't change much. Recorded an episode of the Early Twenties and shit-talked over dinner, it never gets boring: Sodhi talked about optimizing for life energy in the 16 hours we're awake, solid philosophy -- vaguely similar to what i'd learnt from the Mantak Chia in his teachings of Taoism!

Started talking to a beautiful woman over the last couple weeks, and it's been fun observing the changes in my mindset. i've come to the acceptance of the irregularities this brings to life - definitely brings more balance to life. Really looking forward to how this pans out!

i feel like i'm currently at peak performance when it comes to fitness: fairly consistent at two sets of exercises per day, for 7 days a week. Over the last two weeks, i put in 2 days at BJJ(Gi sparring), 6 gym workouts, 3 hits of abs, 1 run, a couple sauna sessions, and a bunch of stretches. Sauna made me light-headed but happy. Friday's ab session still hurts my core. Ending all days in exhausted sleep, love it.

Life's beautiful, keep hammerin'
