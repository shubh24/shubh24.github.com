Welcome to 182, a week where we restarted working from office. 

i turned twenty four on Monday, and it feels very normal for some reason. No crazy bouts of gratefulness or existential thoughts, just turned up for work and went about the day. Cheated with the meal as i ate cake and pizza at my uncle's place for dinner! Earlier today, i wrote my letter to the future via `futureme.org` - i have been writing these letters for five years now, and got a little emotional as i read all the old letters.

At work, i focussed my efforts on backend dev & got my hands dirty as we needed some backup there. i've realized that i like day-to-day operations and it gets me excited - however, i need to zoom out and strategically think about the long-term constantly. The team's going through a bit of flux right now, hiring interviews always going on. Had a bunch of meetings over the week which gave us good ideas about the business model.

Have been watching quite a few coronavirus conspiracy videos, and am beginning to get convinced that they might not be conspiracies - thinking about these things makes me question reality and perceptions. i'll try to restrict this to the minimal from this week onwards, there's no point of a lot of news input.

This weekend was a good mix of rest, work & runs - i've come to a steady state where i sleep for the least amount needed to function on the weekdays and then make up for it over the weekend. Recorded an episode of the Early Twenties podcast, this always makes me happy & makes me question why i dont talk to friends more often. Ran on both days of the weekend, although didn't push myself at all physically.

Over the course of the week, i only put in 3 runs and skipped all workouts - bad end to a month where i had kept up the rhythym till the last week. i've registered for a half-marathon in June, and that should push me to stay on the line.

Keep hammerin'
