Welcome to 195 - it's a little difficult to write this report as i'm preoccupied with work thoughts. Generally, i take out some time to decompress and that gives me a structure for this blog but that isn't the case this time round.

i'm going into overdrive with long nights cranking out backend code nowadays. The solitude of the darkness is very productive - i've been going into `dnd` mode on Slack in the evenings and that has been helping me out a bit as well. 

i've started using the Notes app on my phone to note down all random to-dos that keep popping up in my head. Earlier i used Google Calendar for this, but that had friction because i had to make choices around timings and required a few more clicks. Sometimes i get ideas around backend optimization when i wake up, and it's easy to document them on the home screen.

The weekdend has been relatively less eventful, as i pulled in a late nighter on Saturday, and headed out for an easy 6K on Sunday evening. Didn't indulge in any video call games, but talked to a college friend while cooking dinner. On my run earlier today, i was thinking about where life might be 7 years from now, comparing how the last 7 years have panned out. 

On the fitness front, another week with one missed session - put in two short runs, two workouts and one yoga session. One of the NTC workout included boxing moves, which were a lot of fun and got my back pecs sore for a day or so! Have been watching some Mike Tyson videos this week, which has been so much fun! Overall, i clocked 74 kilometers(11 runs) in May, improving 8K over April - planning to hit a 100 in June!

Been listening to Indian hip-hop as usual, discovered this female artist 'Agsy' who has been on loop all the time! Great time to be a hip-hop fan.

Keep hammerin'
