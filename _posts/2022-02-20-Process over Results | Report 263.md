Welcome to 263.

At work, i realized that even the easiest of things turns out difficult if you want to do it really well. i should keep that attitude towards all aspects of work and life, struggle gives meaning to the job. Had a bunch of external calls this week, spent some time playing around with a few POCs, while a few mornings went deep into thinking. 

GaryVee talks about valuing the 'Process over Results', and it's not a new concept. Lord Krishna speaks on similar lines in the Bhagavad Gita, and i had to remind this to myself a couple times in the week. Not just at work, but also at relationships - belief in the process has led me to where i am, and it's what will keep me on the path.

While on my run earlier today, i realized how my mind succumbs to the path of least resistance - almost as if it's a default assumption. This often leads to judgemental thoughts, and requires constant third-person analysis to walk myself out of it. Listened to a couple episodes on Rogan where they discussed Covid: the guests had a 180-degree viewpoint of the world, and it takes mental effort to listen through all the narratives while being non-judgemental about either.

On the fitness front, i put in 2 runs, 3 gym workouts, 1 NTC home workout and 1 BJJ session. This Saturday's JiuJitsu session held a weird dimension in my head -- there was rock/indie music playing as the humans fought with their brains and limbs, a pretty spiritual experience, if i can take the liberty to use that word! i'll need to improve my sleep routine this week, been a bit irregular with the hours in the past. 

The Dating Relationship Management(DRM) has been active off late, trying to optimize this within my routine as well. Met up with Vivek on Sunday, visited our old home in Indiranagar and talked about all things life.

Keep hammerin'
