Welcome to 325. Time to lock in. Twenty Twenty Five. A few hours left till the clock strikes twelve.

Spent the last few weeks journalling quite a bit, planning out the outline for the new year. Something about the concept of the new year that drives the best out of me. If there's something i've learnt in life, it is that you shall never waste a good date ;)

i'm so so pumped for 2025, brimming with ideas and dreams. This year was quite the teacher, and i'm proud of how i stood up to the challenges. i retreated a bit from this blog, and turned to my private journals a lot more -- rather natural that this blog will evolve along with me. 

The last few weeks have been both fun and intense at the same time. Spent the first half of December in Bangalore, then spent a week in Bombay, a weekend in Delhi, a week in Udaipur, and now closing out the year from Evantson, Illinois. Glad that i was able to spend so much time with family in December, the heart is full and now i'm ready to get back into the grind. 

Earlier this month, i took a "Product Sense" course from Shreyas Doshi, and that has impacted a bunch of mental models in how i understand businesses. Been trying to develop the lens of looking at the world with this new lens.

Been reading Seneca, and boy, every letter i read is like a gym session for the mind. Will be continuing this habit in the new year, and will be actively reading much more. 

Happy with growth in my physique this year. It's gratifying to see the results of labor at the end of it all, and fires me up to work harder. i'm gonna get jacked before our wedding in 2026, i can't wait!

Keep hammerin'
