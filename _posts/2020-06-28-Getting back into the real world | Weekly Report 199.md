Welcome to 199!

Writing this late into Sunday night, after a well-rested weekend. This week was heavier on ideation & management rather than core development for me, and hence don't feel as satisfied with the work output overall. i need to get my hands dirty every now and then! A fair amount of time is also spent on managing day-to-day issues with product trials, and that takes higher precedence over everything else.

i headed out to the office on Wednesday, and worked half a day on-site. It's very clear to me how the office environment can make us more productive during those hours we spend at the office, but the comfort of home can make things better overall. i noticed there was a weird joy in getting ready to go to the office, the psychology of commute is embedded deep within me. Not sure if people who start off their careers without a commute will have the same feeling.

i have been going out into the streets, malls and restaraunts over the last week now that everything has opened up. A very striking feature has been the contact tracing implemented - initially i was hesitant of installing any applications on my phone, but i soon realized that it'd be very difficult to stay without. i don't think this is the best way out, it doesn't seem likely that governments will step back on any amount of tracing once coronavirus subsides. We're living in weird times.

Over the last week, majority of my afternoon meals were not home-cooked, and i think that will be the norm for the next few weeks. It helps me manage my working time better. One thing that i really need to control is the post-lunch energy crash that i experience while working from home. Power naps seem to work so far, but i dont think i should rely on them. 

On the fitness front, i put in all six planned workouts including a trip to the gym as well! i took it very easy on the body, and will do so for the next week before getting to the same weights as before. The dumbbells have been a life saver for home workouts - i've used it twice, and will make this part of usual routine. i'm closing out June at around 50 kilometers, which is a big drop from May's 75 because of compromises made on my long runs - that's fine as long as i stay consistent. Rested the body with a foam-roll session on Sunday, followed by some curry chicken for dinner!

Met a bunch of friends over the weekend for dinner & lunch - it feels so much better than the lockdown weekends playing online games. We take so much for granted. i've been recording more on my GoPro, made a small clip about my fitness journey for a friend - it's always good to reflect and look back on the past. Keeps us grounded.

Okay, big week ahead. Keep hammerin'
