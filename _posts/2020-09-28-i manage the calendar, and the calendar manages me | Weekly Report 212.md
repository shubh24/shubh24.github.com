Insaan bhi kya cheez hai,
ek me wafa nahi,
aur doosre ko wafa ki ummeed hai

Difficult week at work, solving a lot of problems at once. The biggest one occupying my mindshare is maintaining velocity with stability and tech debt, it's one of those problems i can't solve with brute force hard work. This requires deep thinking & building a culture of high engineering output. We launched a fresh look on our website at [www.radicali.io](https://www.radicali.io) this week, and started reaching out as part of our new strategy - an external meeting made me realize the importance of staying close to the product and the user, and not worry too much about metrics or fundraise. Getting those users who'll be fans of the product is most important. 

For me, the schedule got a little difficult to manage as i was running on 5-6 hours of sleep on a daily basis. However, managing the calendar and slotting time in for all tasks ensured i stay on the path and got the minimum work done. Need to improve on slotting in time for deep thinking/research periods.

As a follow-up from my date last week, i spent a lot more time with this person i've grown to like. i want to take it slow and ensure that i'm taking the right decisions, not influenced by physicality. i'm much more balanced this time in managing my hormones than when i experienced the flood of emotions for the first time a few years ago. These are good exercises in optimizing for life force energy, and irrespective of the outcome - i'm sure i'll grow as a person.

On the fitness front, i slacked off - missed my weekend long run & back/bicep workout. Substituted the other gym sessions with home workouts, which are not quite the same to be honest. i need to make sure i'm getting all gym sessions in, otherwise all gains over the last three months will be lost. Silver lining is that i went for a basketball session this weekend, a good reminder of how fun it is to do something that i'm not good at :)

The weekend was a lot of fun - as i met up with a bunch of friends at Arab Street over dinner, and then followed it up with a long poker session. Followed it with 10 hours of sleep, a basketball session on Sunday evening and a good self-cooked chicken dinner. Made sure i got a good amount of work done throughout, although i never get enough done.

At these times, i'm glad that i write these reports. If not for these, i would've never structured my thoughts around a few fuzzy topics on paper.

Keep hammerin'
