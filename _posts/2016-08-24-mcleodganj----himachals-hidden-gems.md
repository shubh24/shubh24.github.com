Welcome to my second travel blog -- Beware of jealousy and envy that this post might generate! 

Post-placements, me and three of my college friends decided to go out on a long-pending trip. Dharamsala was an obvious choice, the HPCA stadium had been on my to-do list for so long!

`Day 1` 

We took an overnight 11-hour bus from Delhi at around 10:30 in the P.M. The route was pretty much a sleepy blur to me, interrupted by quite a few GTA-inspired turns by the driver. We reached Dharamsala in the morning and took a local bus to the McLeod Square, greeted by a film shoot happening bang in the middle! 

In search of breakfast, we reached [Moonpeak Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1092107-d1199629-Reviews-Moonpeak_Espresso-McLeod_Ganj_Dharamsala_Himachal_Pradesh.html), a pretty good cafe that was! I had some banana porridge, apple juice and left in search for a decent hotel room up into the hills. After about an hour of exploring and hotel-hunting, we decided upon [Silver Moon House](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g1092107-d6902422-Reviews-Silver_Moon_House-McLeod_Ganj_Dharamsala_Himachal_Pradesh.html), very close to the Bhagsu falls. If you're thinking of staying up there, be prepared for a 100 calorie workout just to get there.   

Later in the evening, we took off for the Bhagsu Nag waterfalls, one of the more beautiful falls I've seen! The mountain peaks on both sides felt majestic and special! Then, we climbed up till the 'No Name Cafe' and had Maggi on the rocks. Very close to the falls, you'll find a public Swimming Pool(the water is freezing cold!) -- I could feel myself shivering even after completing 2-3 rounds of freestyle across the pool. Since we didn't carry any cameras, I decided to come back again early morning and record some footage. I had some pasta and salad for dinner at a Japanese-ish restaurant -- Sharma's Corner on the Bhagsu Square.

`Day 2`

I took off on the Bhagsu Falls adventure at 7 in the morning, and it was even prettier this time! There wasn't a single soul visible, save some Buddhist monks doing yoga on the hills. I climbed up as far as I could go, without putting myself at risk!  

We checked out of our hotel and visited the [Tibetan Museum Complex](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/himachal-pradesh/mcleod-ganj/sights/religious/tsuglagkhang-complex) -- a quiet and simple monastery. We learnt that Dalai Lama comes here every year for a 5-day stay! Incredible! We also had traditional lunch at the [Tibet Kitchen](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g319724-d1440070-Reviews-Tibet_Kitchen-Dharamsala_Himachal_Pradesh.html) on the McLeod Square -- I really like Tibetan food. The Thupka was great, and so was their Jasmine Tea. 

"Free Tibet" is a very strong movement that runs in the hills and should be encouraged by all of us. I felt lacking in my knowledge of Tibetan culture and traditions.
