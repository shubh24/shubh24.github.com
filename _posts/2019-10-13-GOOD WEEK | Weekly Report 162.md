i recently came across Jocko's video - GOOD. it's looping inside my head, so pumped. Things are going bad? GOOD. This week was hard? GOOD.

Reload. Recalibrate. Reengage.

This week was really good. We made good progress on our product, and on a personal front i wrote more code. i took a wfh on Dussehra as i had a slightly congested throat, and got some good hours of productive work under my belt. 

So much of my time nowadays is spent talking to devs, aligning everybody, and organizing our Trello. Getting some me-time working on the backend makes me realize how much i like building things. 

i have been listening to a lot of Joe Rogan recently, it's a nice place to escape from the real world. Getting back on the Jocko train as i listen to GOOD on repeat while typing out this blog.

i realized that i no longer fall in the 'fomo group', i'm satisfied in having long work hours and not do any 'cool stuff'. Feel more fulfilling to put in a long Friday night at the office rather than waste time away at Clarke Quay. That being said, i played Poker for 3 hours on Friday, but realized that i wasn't really looking forward to it. i spent the weekend decompressing, put in an arms workout on Saturday & slept a ton on Sunday. Had planned for a 3-hour run, but realized my body needed rest & i couldn't get myself to commit to it - i'm kinda proud that i'm better at listening to the body rather than crumbling to my ego.

Had a long chat with Sodhi & Gyani over the weekend, felt good to catchup again. i put in 2 meditation & 1 journal session this week, much below where i want to be. This year's resolution was to wake up at 5AM and go out for a run/workout - there's still 3 months left, and that's enough to build a habit. 

Okay, keep hammerin'
