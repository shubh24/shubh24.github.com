Hey all, welcome to 196/197. As i head closer to four years of this blog, i wonder if my counter is accurate - the anniversaty is still around 3 months away although i'm pretty sure i'd started the blog series in July '16. Seems like errors compound!

The last two weeks have been quite a whirlwind as we raced towards a product release - i put in continuous 12 hour workdays and even went for a 27 hour non-stop marathon on the final day. At that point, i knew why people say being sleepless is similar to being drunk. It's fun to test the body's limits, while i can. 

i hadn't taken an off-day in the last month or so, felt good to take this Saturday easy as i caught up on sleep! The sleep cycle is still suffering because of work-from-home effects, it'll only get back on track with the regular commute to office.

At work, i realized i need to get better at doing feature reviews on my end. i can get better at delegation of responsibilites, and building a sense of accountability within the team. i was listening to Tim Ferris & Derek Siver earlier today for the umpteenth time, and they talked about the topic of being busy vs being productive - i feel like it's so true for me. i'm super busy which means i'm out of control of my time. i should be able to control and dedicate time to the most important things that need my attention.


On the fitness front, i put in three runs & 1 foam-roller session this week but no workouts as i was busy with work in the evenings. Last week was not great either - put in 2 runs, 2 NTC workouts & 1 yoga session. Was listening to a Jocko podcast where he said that he can't workout in the evenings because his time is consumed by others. Morning 4:30AMs are the only times that he has to himself. That's so true, that's one reason why i can work so well in the nights. Need to replicate that for my workouts too. 

Earlier this week, i went to my uncle's place for a birthday party and had quite some junk food - first time i was not eating my own cooked food in over two months! People said that i've grown weaker - that's expected since there's no gymming and no chicken being eaten. Just hope the gyms open up quick. My diet has been rice/curry in lunches and chapati/dal/veggie for dinners - plan to learn some chicken recipe this coming week.

Read about Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide earlier today - how weird is life. Had been watching this guy and grew a bonding with him after his role on Dhoni. What can i do? Appreciate life and move on.

Keep hammerin'
