Welcome to another of my biweekly reports, i'll try to keep it short!

When writing these blogs, i spend quite some time looking at my calendar thinking of all that i did the last couple weeks & try to come up with a consistent theme for the title. Recently, so much has been happening that it has been quite an exercise to find the right theme for the blog!

In the last couple weeks, a lot has happened on the work front. We progressed on our roadmap, onboarded a bunch of interns, and i worked on improving our tech architecture. We now have 5 tech interns and keeping track of the dynamic codebase is becoming quite the challenge for me. Overcommunication and Pull Requests!

We brainstormed about our business plans moving forward, excited with what we're to launch soon! We presented at a startup pitch event, where we were selected for the finals but didn't make it to the winning bunch. There were a few hard days in between -- i have been thinking about this for a while now -- when a person has a purpose that he/she is working towards, they will go to any length to work towards it. Once survival needs are met, purpose(whether self-imposed or induced by external factors) is the only thing that drives human behavior. i try to make the process my purpose, with blind faith.

i watched EF's newest Asia cohort's demo day last Monday - felt weird to be in the audience exactly six months later. Also met a few founders in SG over the last week, feels good to talk to people in the same boat :)

The last two weekends have been heavy with Vitamin-D - something i'm really happy about! We walked the MacRitchie trails(my second time in the past year) last Sunday, and visited the Istana Building earlier today, it's refreshing to get some sunlight once in a while! Istana is Singapore's Rashtrapati Bhawan, we had a really close look at the President. It was insane how low-key(undercover?) the security was! 

Very disappointed with the fitness efforts over the last couple weeks. In my quest to wake up in the mornings and get to work, i have been unable to sneak in my workouts -- only 2/6 last week. The positive is that my sleep cycle is now better, and i'll be working actively to better it over the next month or so!

It's been exactly one year since i landed in SG - what a year it's been :)
