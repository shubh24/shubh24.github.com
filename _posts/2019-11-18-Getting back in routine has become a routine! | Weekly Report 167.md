Welcome to 167.

This week started off on a rather serious note, as i visited an eye doctor to get myself checked. i have been experiencing my eye power going up at an unusually high pace over the last year or so, and decided to get a proper medical checkup this time round. i've been advised to reduce my screen time, ensure i don't have dry eyes, and do a checkup in another week's time. i don't like doctors, i get really scared and extrapolate things badly inside my head. Getting a big monitor for work, and have decided to do zero laptop time post-work.

As Naval said, a healthy man has a thousand problems; a sick man has only one.

Because of the doctor visit, i took the first two days of the week a little easier at work & focussed more on planning stuff out on paper. Couldn't stay away from work too long, and was back at putting in 10-hour days soon enough. Had some good meetings, trying to make some incrementals on my communication style in the company. i've been noticing that some of my weekends have also started to feel a bit like working days - i wake up with a to-do, and although it's not a heavy workload, but there's a fair amount of work to get done. Frankly, i like the days planned out rather than whiling away the weekend doing nothing. 

i have started experimenting with a new lunch/dinner place in Little India, to improve my main meal nutrition - it's a 10 minute walk from home, but worth it! It takes me some time to get back into my weekly routine whenever i come back from India, to get back into the workout/work schedule - getting there.

This Saturday, a bunch of friends headed up to a karaoke place in Clarke Quay - it's my second time out there, was even more fun this time! Vlogged a fair amount, sat around the 'ghats', and returned by 3 in the AM on Sunday. On the fitness front, i put in 3 runs & 1 workout. Had a slight knee niggle post the weekend 10k, but overall i feel strong heading into the last two weeks before the full marathon - i'm not training as i should be, but mentally i feel i should be able to do it.

Right, keep hammerin'

10k, 3 runs, 1 WO
