Welcome, ladies and germs, to Week #132 of my #bloglife! 

This week, we made some midweek deployments and then spent the rest of the time fixing issues caused by it. Testing is so important, why do i learn everything the hard way! Our BAU -- met some potential investors, had customer feedback conversations, and executed. 

Heads down. Execute.

i onboarded a couple of front-end interns late in the week, excited to ramp up our development cycles moving forward! Delegation is a beautiful feature, i'm getting better at it. The five-day sprints seem to be rolling nicely, the weekends are going to be work-heavy with the new interns coming onboard!

Over the weekend, we recorded two episodes of the Early Twenties Podcast -- both of them shall be breaking all our previous records! i was strangely nervous before these conversations, and practiced quite a bit before hosting my show. These podcasts over the weekends push me into a slight introspective mode, thinking about life in macro, which is a great thing to do every now and then.

We released Part 2 of the Siddharth Seth podcast series, go listen!

Met a bunch of BITSian friends in Holland Village on the Friday night -- feels good to reset with people in a non-professional setting. I've begun to realize i really need to take proper rest of my body & mind every weekend!

Touched my workout goals this week -- long awaited! 3 runs, 3 workouts. A quick update -- put in 3 meditation days and 1 journal day over the week. Discipline on this front circles back to discipline in sleep routine. Discipline equals freedom. Something i really need to internalize in the remaining months of 2019.

i was listening to Tim's podcast with Jim Collins, and realized that i should be tracking my hours in the day much more seriously. i should be tracking my sleep in a more organized way. Will build out a plan on this this week. i shouldn't have typed this out here -- actions over intentions.

Anyways, keep hammering. See you next week!
