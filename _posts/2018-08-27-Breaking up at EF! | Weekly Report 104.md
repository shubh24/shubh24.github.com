Welcome to Week 104, to another episode on the reality show that EF is!

We decided to call curtains on our B2B Sales idea, and the team as well. Had quite a few hard conversations with my co-founder, and with my head, as I tried to slither our idea through a valid business model. Couldn't.

We were banking on Data Network effects as our defensibility, and that doesn't seem to come across as a strong enough point for investors-to-be. We'd shown good productivity in terms of iterations on the idea, i even tried out a customer validation experiment on LinkedIn(playing on salesmen's FOMO!). We began having internal doubts on building a marketplace, and that wasn't a good sign.

We could've struggled and done an Airbnb, but we decided to pull the plug. Felt a little insecure, but i don't want that feeling to dictate my decisions. There's nothing to fear, and everything to gain :)

We saw 8 breakups at EF this week, there's maximum liquidity in the market! I'm currently exploring opportunities with other potential co-founders, back to square one.

On the fitness front, this week was a success -- put in a couple of 6K night runs, and one long run(15K). These runs are a great time to let my mind talk to my myself, to zone out and observe. 

Did a little bit of an unwind over the weekend, a Catan night, a Poker night and a morning with my family out here in SG. Can't overstate the importance of weekends in my routine, i'd go crazy otherwise!

Okay lah, later.
