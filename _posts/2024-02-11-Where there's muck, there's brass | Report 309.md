Writing this on a standing desk from Kempegowda Terminal 1, waiting on my flight to Sodhi's wedding. Wild how just ten years ago we two used to talk about pull requests and hackathons, does life always fly by this fast?

Last few weeks have been a roller-coaster. Our team headed out for an offsite to Goa, but then came down with covid the week after. Last week at work has had me swimming deep in the problem/solution space, and product strategy/building is something i really enjoy. 

The time off with the team was a lot of fun, getting to know humans is always such a fun exercise. Stayed in this place called Oxel this time(near Vagator), and went up the Dil Chahta Hai fort to catch some beautiful views! 

Was completely out of action with covid for a couple days, as i ran a slight fever. However, glad that i was able to recover and get back without much long-term impact to stamina/strength. 

The gym sessions with the new trainer have been progressing well, and i can see the small differences in form/technique can affect gains. i still would like to get more consistent to the point where i'm hitting the gym at least five days a week. Currently weighing in at 70KGs on the dot, and would like to bump this up by a couple kilos in this quarter.

Ending this blog at my airbnb in Delhi, can't wait to get started with the week tomorrow. Keep hammerin'
