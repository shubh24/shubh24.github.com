*"Tobey Maguire got bit from a spider, but me? See, it was a GOAT" -- Em.*

Phew, what bars! Writing another of these reports from an airport gate -- i love these ones, penning the blogs looking at these flying machines take off.

Work's been fun this week as well, as i realize how company-wide outcomes are highly dependent on the levels of clarity in people's minds. One of our core jobs-to-be-done as leaders is to drive clarity, and execution will follow. At one point, my goal has elevated from "how much execution i drive", to "how much clarity i drive". i still put in as many hours, but at a slightly different plane. Think concepts. Think frameworks. Think strategy.

As we take important decisions as leaders, i also realize how crucial of a skill decision-making is. Requires me to develop a sense of charting out eventualities, inverting questions to look at the decision from different angles, being unemotional, but most impotantly, how to trust my gut. i don't think we get better at decision-making without taking bad decisions -- making bad decisions in the past, but still trusting your gut is where the dichotomy lies!

Fitness routine this week has been strong. Put in 4 afternoon workouts at the gym, and this routine just kills the afternoon post-lunch crash! That being said, i'll be switching my routine to morning workouts from this week onwards.

Gonna get back into the grind from MONDAY, keep hammerin'
