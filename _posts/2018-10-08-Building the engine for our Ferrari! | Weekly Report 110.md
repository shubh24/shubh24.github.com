Week 110(1st Oct - 7th Oct '18), a disciplined week in terms of daily routines, a good week in terms of prototyping our solution.

One thing i've been struggling with is distributing my time/bandwidth between ideation and execution. At what point should i move to a different algorithm or a different strategy, and when should i push harder. How should i plan my week's timelines. At what time should i call it a day for efficient functioning. Rapid prototyping is fun.

We went through EF's mock check this week, and got some good feedback -- need to improve on product clarity, timelines, go-to-market and communication. We have quite a few checkins this week to brainstorm and improve on these aspects.

I have been reading up quite a lot on designing startups with the AI-first philosopy, around developing moats around our solutioning to build defensibility in the long-term. Good insights, and a lots to think about.

Spent the better part of the week developing basic algorithms to show our value prop to customers. Felt super happy to get back in my natural habitat and execute!

I came back into terrific routine this week, journalled and meditated every day of the week! Improved on my sleep patterns with a new wind-down routine. Given my addiction with screens, it is tough to let go an hour before bedtime! Blinds along my windows, no alarms and sleep meditation have helped me get my sleep back :)

On the fitness front, i put in my 3 runs -- even clocked a 20 kilometer over the weekend. Happy with the efforts, but I need to get back with weight training -- am starting a gym routine this week, no excuses.

Yeah, later.
