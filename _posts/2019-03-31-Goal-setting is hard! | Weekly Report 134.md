Welcome boys and girls, to Week 134 of the #bloglife -- i'm running out of opening statements! 

*I couple to the derivative -- Safi Bahcall* 

I heard Safi on the Tim Ferris podcast, and this particular line stuck with me -- he says that he couples to the learning curve, in the sense an electron might couple to a photon. That resonated with me hard, because i relish in learning curves, irrespective of what i'm learning.

Over the last week, i spent quite a bit of our time planning the roadmap and thinking about resource allocation for the next month. Goal-setting and creating deadlines with such minimal information is super-difficult, but that's what makes it fun.

I heard of the phrase, "Months, not quarters" when discussing about experimentation with our product -- and that feels so right to me! we can't be wasting time by building out elaborate product plans -- fail fast and pivot! 

i was super-pumped after a customer call, talking to users and listening to their experience gives me quite a bit of inspiration!

In the middle of the week, i headed up to the Projector for a bi-annual event in Singapore -- the EF Demo Day livestream all the way from London. It's a nice refresher on my journey, and also exposes me to the cutting-edge in startups!

Over the weekend, we released another episode of the Early Twenties Podcast where we invited Nikita Tanwani on the show!

On the fitess front, i crushed all runs and workouts this week -- including a couple of really late night runs, like 1AM runs. Happy with the efforts, i discovered foam rolling this week -- i might have found true love in my foam roller! Ended March with 64 kilometers in the kitty, which ranks in the lowest months in terms of mileage. Not worried too much about it though, as long as i enjoy running and turn up everyday, i'm happy :)

Over March, i put in 19 days of meditation and 11 journal days. I am starting a new time tracking routine soon inspired by Jim Collins, more on this in the coming blogs! I also came to a realization that i am much more likely to stick to process-driven goals rather than outcome-driven goals, i have been thinking a lot about goal setting lately. Yep, i'll share more soon :)

Okay enough, see ya next week!
