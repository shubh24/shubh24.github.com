Welcome to 193!

One of the rare times i've used a clickbait for this blog - but it's kinda true. i'm currently on a messed up sleep schedule and might be at one of my highest average screen times. Not going out of the house in the day has gotten the body out of sync with the normal calendar structure. When i observe my thoughts, i realize that negative thoughts are popping up more often than usual and i'm not doing anything constructive to fix it. 

At work, i put in effort on certain data issues and worked out the implementation/architecture of a few backend tools. There were lesser number of client-facing meetings, so could focus wholly on development. i realized that my fingers now subconsciously type `meet.google` on the browser tab instead of `youtube` - which means wfh has officially become a habit for the body. We have started looking at our product critically now, which is raising more tech debt issues by the day - and it's an engineering problem that i need to work on.

i'm currently listening to a fresh JRE episode with Rhonda Patrick where they talk about the importance of Vitamin-D, especially as an immunity boost against coronavirus. To solve for the problem of the messed up sleep routine, i need to sweat it out in the sun. 

On the fitness front, i missed my Wednesday speed workout and one workout session. Put in one recovery run, two core workouts and one foam-roller session - planning for a long run tomorrow(Sunday) evening. The late night work sessions eat into my workout schedule and make me feel like a sloth till the next morning.

Cooking has been going as planned, however i've stopped growing in skillset - i need to be pushing myself to learn new things and go deeper. Otherwise, this can become a chore and something i don't look forward to on a daily basis. i was looking at my personal expenses over the last few months, and the lockdown period has been really healthy on the account statement - makes you question all the purchases you make in everyday life.

i met a junior this week, social interaction after months felt quite good. Did a couple calls with the boys during the week, that always keeps the weeknights lively. Played online Catan earlier today, this is becoming a nice little weekend ritual in the lockdown! i've been on an intermittent fasting kinda schedule because of my sleep cycle now(with a 12 hour window). On one day of the week(typically Fridays) - i've been skipping lunch which gives me a 16-17 hour window, although i do have snacks in the middle.

Anyway, this has been a long report. i saw Casey's covid video he recently published and that inspired me to start recording certain aspects of my current lockdown lifestyle - planning to break down my videos into four categories: `outside world in lockdown`, `working from home`, `home workouts`, and `cooking`. i'll probably not release these videos, but this will be a good documentation for my future self 10 years down the line. We lived through Covid-19.

Keep hammerin'
