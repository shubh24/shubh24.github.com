My weekly report from the 29th of May to the 4th of June -- productive week, i must say. Running short on sleep!

The Quora challenge continued, as i worked on a handful of features this week -- implemented the weighted graph structure for features like weighted neighbors ratio and weighted neighbors contribution. Also used the graph to make a basic PageRank model, i even released a [kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh24/pagerank-on-quora-a-basic-implementation) on it, good response so far! 

For the past 3-4 days, i've been struggling in building a strong keras pipeline, and tuning the hyperparameters. Have come a long way in learning about the technical details though, it's been good learning. The neural network has given a decent score, but not better than my xgboost model, currently lingering around the 500 mark on the leaderboard. A couple of days left in the competition, i'll try a couple of models, probably make a simple stacker and figure out the oversampling piece. Expect a comprehensive blog on QuoraDup soon!

With QuoraDup ending and the bronze medal looking tough, i'll be focussing on a couple of other competitions now -- probably the Mercedes manufacturing one and the indiahacks ml challenge.

At work, i'm back on the UserJourney piece -- trying to derive insights from usage patterns. A regular in the day of a Product Manager! Earlier in the week, the analytics db was facing some issues and i had to figure out the backup queries for a day or so -- stressful. Attended the June townhall, inspiration as usual! 

This weekend, i spent a day with DataKind volunteers working on some cool ML/Data viz projects -- it's a really good community of passionate data guys who come together to solve various real-world problems faced by NGOs. I worked on a project involving "Pollinate Energy" to identify certain communities via proxy data like education, health and transport facilities in those specific areas. While there were a lot of ML challenges(less data, duplicates, sampling biases, unbalanced data), but i found the data collection challenges to be more intersting! Was a good experience, raring to go again!

The Nike Run plan is up and running, went for three runs involving a tempo as well as a long run! Also went for a much-wanted tennis session earlier yesterday -- Bangalore Garros ;)

That's it folks! Later.
