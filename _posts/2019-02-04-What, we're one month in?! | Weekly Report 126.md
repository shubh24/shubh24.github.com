Welcome to another week in the whirlwind journey of this continuum of... wait, what? It's February already?

Over the past week, we slogged it out both on product development and fundraising. It feels as if you're doing two jobs in the time of one! I was busy building scrapers for regulatory websites for the last 3-4 days, while also mapping out the final set of features to be rolled out in our paid pilots.

The plannig fallacy is such a wonderful truism.

On the fundraising front, i learnt up on a bunch of technicalities and got a better understanding of the angel investment market here in Singapore. Talking to other startups makes you feel like everyone is in the same boat, and trying to get to the shore. Just that everyone is super-alone!

This weekend was slightly low on productivity, as i caught up with friends & family, and chilled a little! We put out our weekly episode on the Early Twenties podcast, talking about mental strength on this one, suno suno :)

I am almost halfway through my first book of the year -- "The Art of Thinking Clearly", hope to finish it soon. It's become my post-meditation practice for the days i take it a little easier after getting up. I put in around 17 days of meditation, and 13 days of journalling in January, not where i'd like the numbers to be but still pretty good given the kind of schedules i faced!

Fitness workouts were on-point this week, the long long run has been elusive for a while now! I wonder how all these long-distance runners cram their workouts in their daily schedule, all the while being productive. Casey Neistat had run 4 marathons in 7 days sometime back, while i haven't been able to run a 30K in the last two weeks. Incredible.

Anyways, that's the week that was. Till next time, alvida!
