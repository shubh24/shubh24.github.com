A bi-weekly report from the 16th to the 29th of July -- a couple weeks that absolutely flew by. I'll be starting my journey at EF tomorrow early morning, and writing this blog post late in the night doesn't seem like a really good idea :p

I spent 5 days in Bombay, chilled out, discussed startup ideas with Dad, and ran drenched in the Bombay rains. Or did i? 

I packed 3 heavy bags, one skateboard and headed off to Sri Lanka for one last trip! pSentisem productions(Sodhi, Gyani and me) met in Colombo, we headed off to Arugam and learnt to surf over the waves! It was one helluva trip, strong on shaka, high on adrenaline. I spent close to 6 hours in the water on the last day, i just didn't want to come out of the struggle!

We discussed startup ideas, made an incredibly high number of dick jokes, chilled by the beach, and learnt a good amount of life lessons over the 10-day long trip. Travel does for the soul, what education does for the mind. Also, put out 4 vlogs over the trip, a lot more in the pipeline.

I am super-excited about my new "job" starting tomorrow, I probably haven't felt more imposter-y in my life. But I know its a phase, and i just gotta enjoy my work. Have figured my stay in Singapore over the next three months, a major part of the logistics nightmare is over! 

Haven't been on a regular fitness or diet schedule owing to the constant flux. Managed to sneak in 3 runs in Lanka though :) The diet and gym sessions should become a thing in a couple of weeks time. I can't deprioritize fitness, won't deprioritize fitness!

Yeah, that's that. Expect an EF update blog soon :)
