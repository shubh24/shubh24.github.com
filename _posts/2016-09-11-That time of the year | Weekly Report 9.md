My weekly report - from the 5th of September to the 11th of September. These days were dedicated, in their entirety, to the wonderful game of tennis!

Our annual sports fest, [BOSM](http://bits-bosm.org) marks one of the highlights in my college life -- this would be my 4th and final BOSM, and I'll be giving my all to it! They are 4 days of almost-continuous action on the courts, where we manage the logistics along with fighting for a medal. The fest does strike an emotional chord -- it is one of those things in my life I genuinely give a shit about! 

We've been practising from anywhere between 3-6 hours daily, and for a majority of the remaining time I've been catching up on exhaustion-sleep! I've realized my diet is nowhere close to support the kind of practice we're having. Hopeful for a medal position this time - fingers crossed!

I also went on a couple of skateboarding missions late into the night with [psdh](https://www.facebook.com/prabhjyot.singh.12) for some cool footage.

This was an attempt at orchestrating a cross-over at the Workshop Cross!

Tailgating behind a bicycle -- I know it's stupid!

So, that's pretty much of what I've been upto. I need to prioritize my goals and current projects for better productivity (post-BOSM that is!)

Later folks!
