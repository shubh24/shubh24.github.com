364 days earlier, i wrote a yearly blog report -- [2016 was great \| 2017 will be better!](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/report/2016/12/29/2016-was-great-2017-will-be-better!.html). 

2016 was good, but you know what was better? 2017. 

And just so you know, what's gonna be bettering better? 2018.

By the way if you think this is a narcissistic blog, i just wanna ensure -- it is ;)

i'd set out with a bunch of 2017 goals, lets do a comprehensive review:
 - **Top 10% of a Kaggle competition**: I spent roughly two months each on a couple of Kaggle competitions, ranking within the Top 15% and Top 12% of the leaderboard. Not quite there, but i'd give myself half a strike.
 - **Fitness schedule**: I've never been on a more regular fitness schedule, all my weeks are mapped out with run and workout sessions. At all times, i have a marathon goal at least three months into the future. 
 - **Read more, consume less**: Well, i'm consuming less -- more like zero. I have eliminated all [news](https://jamesaltucher.com/2012/07/go-on-a-news-diet-starting-today/), and all stupid social media from my life -- whats all this frickin hype with Virushka?! I'm very conscious about what content i consume, its mostly Casey Neistat, Gary Vee, Peter McKinnon and Mumbiker Nikhil. I'm still trying to build a regular reading habit -- i have put out a couple book review vlogs too. Still not quite there, it needs to become a subconscious decision.
 - **Bigger & better blogs**: This hasn't been one of my priorities lately -- i'm still regular with my weekly blogs, but the bigger projects are amiss. Need to get back on it!

With that out of the way, lets get into a **52-week Mega-Massive-Comprehen-fuckin-sive Report**! 

i went for a [nice little trip to Malvan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBqzNjdplgQ), a small fishing town near Bombay. We scuba dived! That was fun. Got kicked out of a bus in the middle of the night for sleeping in an unreserved seat. That wasn't fun.

i joined Belong as an analytics intern, i don't think i've been on a steeper [learning curve](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/report/2017/06/17/What-I-learnt-in-my-internship-at-Belong!.html). Not just in terms of tech, but startups, culture, leadership. Came back heavily inspired :)

i worked on a bunch of kaggle datasets. i turned [kernels expert](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh24), hit the 50th rank worldwide :)

i ran the beautiful [Auroville half-marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfWC7ROX4GE). i injured my knee, was out of action for three months. 

i worked on the NYC rental prediction challenge, hit Top 15%. Wrote a [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/analytics-on-the-new-york-rental-market-top-17-on-kaggle-91bb139d8f4b) about it, got accepted as a writer in 'Towards Data Science', a Medium publication.

[i turned 21](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/report/2017/02/26/The-streak-is-back,-as-i-turn-21-Weekly-Report-29.html). We went to Glocal, it was crazy!

i was bitten by the sports analytics bug. Worked on two blogs on the Fedal rivalry and one on the Boston Marathon. An [Australian Sports blog](https://tennisnerds.blogspot.in/2017/05/featured-guest-blog-deep-dive-analysis.html?spref=fb) picked it up, i just went international :)

i discovered the magical Cubbon Park. i went to Cubbon to run, to skateboard, it became my [favorite place](https://youtu.be/bDbI1ZeJVGI)!

i worked my nights away on the Quora challenge on Kaggle. Hit Top 12%, wrote a [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/identifying-duplicate-questions-on-quora-top-12-on-kaggle-4c1cf93f1c30), it has became my most-read one to date.

i watched the Indian Tennis Team kick Uzbekistan's ass at Davis Cup, Bangalore. Was a unique experience.

i went on a 10-day trip to Bhutan, one of the more happier places i've been to! Wrote a [blog](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/travel/2017/06/27/Bhutan-An-overload-of-culture-shocks!.html), made a [vlog](https://youtu.be/SXZzhEcZJY8)! 

i joined Myntra Data Sciences. my first job. i hadn't been this psyched in a long long time!

i met [Shreya](https://www.facebook.com/shreya.singh.9421450), she's on my favorite people list now! Thanks for everything, blue whale ;)

i went back to Pilani for my Convocation. Seemed like nothing had changed, not the people, not the place! i made a [convo vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iqvzB90DsU), has become my most-viewed video!

i got myself a bicycle. its the best mode of transport :)

i went to a quite a few parties. i don't like parties. i don't go to parties. i'd rather write a blog about how much i hate parties than go to a party.

i participated in the Indiahacks ML challenge, [ranked in the Top 15](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2017/07/04/Top-15-finish-in-Indiahacks-Machine-Learning-challenge!.html) in the finals. [Taj Vivanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lns1r4WAx4), yet [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb4HfhoCpII)!

i got myself a GoPro. i started a super-ambitious experiment to make [one vlog every week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLl6--HLKw). 16 weeks in, still going strong.

i worked on another Kaggle challenge(Web Traffic prediction), didn't give it my 100 percent. Disappointed with my [efforts](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2017/09/10/Predicting-web-traffic-on-Wikipedia-Live-Kaggle-Competition.html).

i ran the Satara Hill half-marathon, its been the best marathon i've been to! Words fall short to tell the experience, so i made a [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsIG415SKNU) :p

i [pushed my first A/B test](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/report/2017/10/15/Pushing-and-reporting-my-first-A-B-test-in-production,-and-completing-Rafa-Weekly-Report-59.html) in production. our hypothesis failed. i learnt quite a lot of shit.

i began weight training. i suck at it, pretty bad. Gotta see the shit through, no one knew how to walk when they were born.

i visited Hampi, its basically heaven with rocks. Made a [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btEXQww5Orw), put Shreya's face in the thumbnail, got a lot more views than i should have!

i started work on the [RTO problem at Myntra](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/report/2017/10/30/Working-full-time-on-the-RTO-problem,-and-a-weekend-trip-to-Hyderabad-Weekly-Report-61.html). It is as "real-world data science" as it gets. Dirty data, assumptions and a lot of headaches!

i visited Sodhi for a [weekend trip in Hyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8KEZWu-tWs). CharMinar isn't hyped, it is beautiful! 

i ran. i [ran more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV2HekBDkRY).

i ran the Kaveri Trail half-marathon. The post-run dip in the Kaveri is pure bliss, [go watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_9eOfFuGoI)!  

i [began skateboarding again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1G3nuSIao). On a regular schedule now, i can ride the skatepark wave now!

i started playing squash, it feels more strategic than tennis. Or maybe that's just my neural nets getting trained!

i built an end-to-end DS pipeline at work, proud of my efforts. Gotta push it through prod now! 

i'm super-focused now -- i journal everyday, i vlog almost everyday, i blog every Sunday, i have a bunch of tasks to cross off everyday, and my ToDos list doesn't end. A state of mind i wanna be in. Always. Forever.

With two days to go before 2k18, i'm heading for a solo trek to Kumar Parvat! Wish me luck :)

*Phew, that took me longer than i'd thought!*

**Now, goals for 2018:**
 - Career-wise, i have a major slightly-scary goal. Wanna keep that to myself, for now. That, or YC 2019.
 - The Top 10% on Kaggle has been close, yet elusive. Get there!
 - I wanna be in the physical conditions to run a full-marathon by year-end. Aiming for Standard Chartered 2019.
 - I stand at 62 subscribers on my Youtube. Aiming for a 1000 by year end. Moonshot. But moonshots exist for a reason.
 - Read more. Put in deep work. Eliminate distractions. Eliminate social media. 
 - I hope i'm in an emotionally mature position by next year. I struggle with being fulfilled or content, you might have guessed that by now :p

Boy, let the narcissism end! Later!
