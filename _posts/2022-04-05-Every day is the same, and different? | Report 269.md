Welcome to 269!

Recently i was thinking of how all human beings are moving through space with completely different lived experiences, but the only thing tying them together is the experience of time. An artificial construct that every human being follows - and somehow everyone is doing a Q1 review of their lives, all at the same time. i was listening to Matt Mullenweg on Tim Ferris, and he mentioned that as an executive, everyday is different! If two days are ever the same, you're doing something wrong - something deep here about how you can generate serendipity from routine.

Work was fun, sometimes i feel lucky to be doing what i do on a daily basis - having complete control over how i manage my hours. Worked on integration testing for a good chunk, and thought about how i can improve my efficiency on macro/micro goals. Every week teaches something new about leading teams!

Headed out to Ooty on Friday evening after a packed day, and woke up in the hills. Overnight buses are time travel, they just take slightly longer than flights. Bunch of Bitsians and me ran the 15K/30K route on the Doddabetta peak on Sunday morning, which just turned out to be one of my happiest runs [ever](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb4OkQIFNOY/). We walked around the Lower Bazaar, saw Rajiv Gandhi's statue bang in the middle of the city and headed over to a tea factory! Ate chocolates, and then ate a few more, lit up a fireplace in the airbnb and then stretched out before sleeping in. Beautiful sights on the run as i nursed my knee after the run, they're not as bad as a runner's knee but i'd be in bad shape if i had gone for 30K. Took another time travel back to Bangalore, in the city by Monday morning.

On the fitness front, i put in two gym workouts in addition to the one long run. For the next three months, i'm aiming to hit 50KG on bench, 50kg on squats and 20kg on the EZ-curl. Regularity on BJJ is still not up to the mark, and i need to get back on track. 

Sunsama tells me i've been ripping through over the last few weeks, life's just flying by. Exactly how i'd want it to be. Keep hamemrin'
