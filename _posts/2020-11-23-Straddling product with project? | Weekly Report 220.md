Welcome to 220. One of my favorite numbers, thanks to Alessandro Volta!

i'm feeling stretched between project management and product management. Not sure if it's my style of working, but thinking and doing don't follow the same neural pathways in my head. i can context switch b/w backend, frontend, calls, planning etc seamlessly, but when it comes to thinking about product vision and critically analyze the shortcomings. It's also affecting my ability to code actively - since i'm context switching, i'm not able to do either things properly. It could be my rationalization to procrastinate thinking about difficult topics, but this is something i seriously need to get better at. 

Did a production deploy this week, always feels good to push things through. Had to take a few hard decisions at work, had a few good discussions around engineering structure. Happy about the time i put in, satisfactory after many weeks.

i'm currently listening to Tom Green on JRE, where they're talking about living the nomadic van life. One thing that struck me is living through the sunrises everyday - time is limited, and i can literally count on my fingers the number of times i've seen the sunrise in Singapore. There's ample pretty run trails to do so in Singapore. i remember promising this to myself in my third year of engineering: Watch the sunrise/sunset everyday - something i don't really subscribe to.

i went on three virtual Lunchclub meetings this week, two of them with tech/VC folks from the US. None of them very productive, i'll be planning these more judiciously in the future.

i've noticed one unique pattern to my thinking: whenever i'm sleeping and wake up to read Slack/Whatsapp notifs in bed, i have instinctively angry reactions. There's something about the sleep state of the mind that makes it dangerous to reply to messages. Need to avoid.

i haven't been sleeping well enough, did three consecutive 5-6 hour nights. i think that lack of sleep haunted me as i caught a cold over the weekend and couldn't function optimally. i've recovered as of Monday, but i need to take better care of the body.

Update on NoFap: Currently on Day 17, feels quite easy this time round. No weird instincts so far, the body's got used to this.

On the fitness front, i put in three quick runs but skipped the long run on the weekend due to the running nose. i put in two gym days, skipped leg day on Thursday.

Visited Dempsey Hill over the weekend with a bunch of friends, my third visit in the last couple months! Saw a few big catfishes in their artificial ponds, had a smoothie, and took pretty rain timelapses on the GoPro.

Currently writing this on Monday night, lots to do this week. Keep hammerin'
