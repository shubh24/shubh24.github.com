Welcome to Report 190.

Living in isolation is normalized now, although it gets a little frustrating at times. Thinking about the reopening seems a little scary, can we handle all the socializing!

Although my home office setup is directly under sunlight, i do miss sweating it out in the morning - another argument for me to switch my workout routine to early mornings. Vitamin D is underrated.

At work, i got back to writing code on the backend & also on the data science side of things! Had fun, even pulled an all-nighter on Saturday running some experiments - it always makes me happy thinking that i have the stamina to do this. Reminds me of the days when i started pulling all-nighters when i was 15 and used to solve physics problems from HC Verma. 

A great positive has been my continued cooking streak - i've started preparing both lunch & dinner and have figured out slightly optimized routines. In fact, cooking amidst lockdown & balancing it with work was one of the topics we discussed in our sprint summary on Friday! 

On the fitness front, this was a successful week - put in 3 runs, 3 workouts & 1 foam-roll session. My mileage in April is already over 60 kilometers, amongst the highest in recent months. The muscles feel sore on many days, the good kind of sore. Home cooked food makes things better as well.

It would be unfair if i didn't mention the hip-hop beef between Emiway and Divine which i've been obsessed about! Waiting for Divine's reply :)

Keep hammerin'
