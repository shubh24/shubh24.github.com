*I have an addictive personality, ... and i focus on the things in life that i can get addicted to* -- Casey Neistat

My weekly report from the 18th to the 24th of June -- productive, fun, fulfilling.

I got in touch with four members in my EF cohort, and did quite a lot of background research on various industries. From manufacturing to healthcare to the creative industry, I'm trying to understand their problems, and figure out the right product-market fit. Decision-making is tough, i should make a generic decision tree to help me in this process, because its gonna come up again & again. Looking forward to talking with more folks over the coming week, excited!

Last week's vlog was delayed, but here it is nonetheless!

I made a three-day trip to Hyderabad, a happy trip, a fulfilling one. Stayed over at Sodhi's place, met up with a couple college friends, and rode a hoverboard for the first time in my life! 

Also, ran my seventh and fastest half-marathon to-date. 1 hour, 51 minutes, 13 seconds. I'm addicted to running, addicted to the things that matter.
  
This week was not so strong on the gym sessions(1 out of 3), gotta make amends. I visited my nutiritionist this week, got a positive report -- The muscles are up, fat is minimally down. Happy! Got a new pair of Asics running shoes, put in a debut run in Hyd too! All in all, going strong, gotta keep strong.

Yeah, that's it. Later!
