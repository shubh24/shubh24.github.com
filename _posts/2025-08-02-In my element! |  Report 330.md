Report 330, can't believe it's August already! This year has been a speedrun unlike any other, every week shows up with a newness and every weekend is different!

It's been 5 weeks at my new role at Browserbase, and i feel totally in my element right now. Digging into all facets of the role -- doubling down on our sales motion, speaking to customers everyday, thinking product, getting my hands dirty with the core infra codebase. Definitely a lot for me to absorb from everyone around, most importantly, building the right mindset for an infrastructure business. Paul's energy is incredible, very much the founder mode that i respect, lots to learn from him.

We had a week-long offsite in Maui, where i saw rainbows like i've never seen before.

We sailed with dolphins, surfed so many waves, ran along the beach, hiked around the mountains, and replied to a bunch of customer tickets. Beautiful offsite!

Also spent a few days in New York for a bunch of customer meetings -- schedule was super-slammed and i couldn't really Casey Neistat the city. i hope i get the chance to spend more time in the city and soak it all in! That being said, spent a very wholesome weekend in Jersey with family and came back home with a full heart.

San Franciso has been growing on both Anukshi and me recently, as we've started living here like locals. Heading to farmers markets, hopping across weekend breakfast spots, finding happiness in the everyday. Groundhog Day :))

Have been patchy with fitness, but getting better at the gym last couple weeks. Have still not gotten regular at BJJ, and i really need to build more discipline to make the 7am classes.  Bodyweight's hovering around 70kg, and i need to hit the pedal in the last stretch of the year now.

Lots to do tomorrow and i should get to sleep, keep hammerin'
