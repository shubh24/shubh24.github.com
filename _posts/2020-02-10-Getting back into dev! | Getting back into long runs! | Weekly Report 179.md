Welcome to 179, writing this from my living room. i've been here for more than 18 months now, the place where i spent countless nights pacing up & down thinking about how to build our product in the early stages. Now, that things happen more in the office than in this living room - i tend to forget those times. 

At work, i decided to spend my energy in backend dev this week as we're pushing towards a sprint release next Friday. i didn't chunk my calendar this week with tasks as i wasn't following my schedule properly - although i feel i can work with a middle ground. Maybe i can't plan the whole week by the hour on Monday mornings, but i can do it for the next day.

i'm proactively spending a lot more time on code reviews throughout all projects - i realize that there needs to be more empathetic code reviews, so that it helps us out in the long run and spreads the culture throughout. Earlier today, i was listening to Reid Hoffman & Reid Hastings talk about culture in startups - it's so easy to say that we'll hire people with first-principle thinking, but it's so so hard to do.

There's this Coronavirus scare doing the rounds in Singapore, and has taken up a good chunky headspace in people's minds. i think that people need things to worry about, because we're wired to be problem-solvers. Either that, or it's natural to worry more as people age - maybe people realize the value of life more. In any case, i gotta be careful.

Listened to a bunch of different podcasts this week as i shuffled between Tim Ferris, TWIML, Joe Rogan, Peter Attia & H3 productions. i might come up with a weekly schedule so that i can good chunks of listening time through the week & still keep up with all the good content coming out!

This weekend was good - put in work on both days, but not as intensely as weekdays. Met a bunch of friends, planned & serendipitous. Put in a long run earlier today evening along the Kallang riverside - had been missing these runs for a couple months now. The body was not a 100% - just proves that everything is perishable and i need to keep putting in the miles to keep the body used to the grind. 

Overall, i put in 2 runs & 3 workouts this week, missed out on the speed run on Wednesday & couldn't find a good tennis partner this weekend. Could be better, but good effort put in. i left my computer at the office for 5 out of 7 days, so that i could detach - however i still looked at the phone screen. Good start, need to slowly detach completely, it's not an easy addiction to get rid of!

Okay, keep hammerin'
