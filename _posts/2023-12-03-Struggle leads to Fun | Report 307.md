Welcome to 307!

i recently learned of the different types of Fun - the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 makes so much sense. Type 1 Fun is fun in the moment, while Type 2 fun is miserable in the moment. So much of what i do is Type 2!

Work's been a bit stressful for the last couple weeks, to be honest. When things go sideways, they go sideways all at once - and it's important to recognize that so i can fight through it. As the org grows and as our customers grow, an evolved form of myself should come up to rise to the occassion. i can foresee that the next few months will be intense as well, and my body & mind shall metamorphosize.

There've been some early mornings, some late nights at work. At these points, i need to treat myself like a world-class "work athlete" and know how to rest so that i can get back to being world-class the next day. 

Started off JiuJitsu last Monday early morning and practised Full-Nelson to Darce in Turtle. Been hitting the gym regularly, while running on occassion on the weekends. 

i've been helping Anukshi with a few of her courses, and the business cases in MBAs do seem quite fun! Sunday evening today, sleeping in early to hit BJJ tomorrow. Keep hammerin'
