Welcome to 186.

This week was a deploy week, where i focused on integration testing and info security. We decided to work from home and i brought my workstation to my dining room! Have been disturbing my housemates being on video calls for many hours, but it's been quite some fun. Realized how lucky we are in the software engineering field to have almost zero impact on productivity because of the virus.

One thing that i need to get better at is having cut-off times for work in the nights - there's no commute to phychologically switch off and i need to artificially generate that. 

Over the last week, i tried to limit my news intake regarding coronavirus and have been successful at keeping my sanity in check. i'm trying to limit myself to long-form content from Peter Attia, JRE & Tim Ferris. The silver lining with the whole world working from home is friends getting on a lot more video calls - i like that :)

On the fitness front, i put in a short run on Monday but felt some niggles in my knees that have been coming up throughout the week. i decided to pause on runs for a while, and have put in 4 bodyweight workouts since - still going out to the canals so i get some fresh air once a day. i'm in the process of building a routine with these bodyweight workouts - mixing up pushups, squats, lunges, dips & abs. i'll avoid going to the gym for the next month or so, but it's super important to get some form of exercise everyday - there's too much residual energy in the body otherwise.

Spent the Saturday reading up about epidemiology and taking it easy. Have been thinking about my long-term goals recently - i think i have more clarity in life than i had a couple years back, but there's still quite a few questions unanswered in my head. 

Keep hammerin'
