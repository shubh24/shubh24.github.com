Welcome to 320, writing this from Caltrain heading to a Diwali dinner! i see a bunch of funny costumes all around, it's a Halloween + Diwali combo tonight! 

Wild that we're closing out October already, work's been both fun & intense at the same time. Always good to look back at the weeks and see how all the minor struggles were worth it. Gotta remember to keep the eyes on the long term, and not get bogged down with the day-to-day!

AI moves quick - just in the last couple weeks, we saw Anthropic drop their web-agents, and OpenAI ship their SearchGPT integration. Technology increasingly feels like magic, and as a builder, it opens my mind to so many ideas and things i wanna build everyday! Super exciting!

Circumstances conspired against me, and i was off-gym for one entire week. Back on the grind this week. Riding a 5-day streak right now, feeling strong.

Explored a new part of the city, Nob Hill, and absolutely loved the views from up there. The hills are fun to climb, probably the steepest city slopes i've seen. I'm gonna jump on one of those trams too, soon!
