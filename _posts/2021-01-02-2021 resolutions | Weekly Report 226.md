Welcome to 226. Welcome to 2021(well, time is monotonously increasing towards infinity, days, weeks and years are just irrelevant markers?)

This is a new year blog, and i'm going to document a list of resolutions that i wish to achieve this revolution. Most of these are going to be process oriented, and we'll call this the 2021 manifesto. On the last weekend of each month, i'm going to do a check-in on this blog as to how i'm performing along each of the stated manifesto points. The manifesto is open to changes as well, everything here is an experiment.

After the resolutions, i'll do a recap of the week(#226) that was.

Work: The goals here are very straightforward, we need to find product market fit and there is a revenue target we're aiming for. From a personal standpoint, i aim to get better at tech leadership: this includes project management, strategic thinking and obviously keeping myself sharp on the tech know-how. I'm bad at documenting learnings on this front, and future blogs shall serve the purpose.

A major theme this year is going to be understanding wealth - i'm at a decent point in my life when it comes to finances, but i don't understand the different models of investment to grow. The first step is to become well-educated(books/podcasts/talking to people) in this area, and then start with basic budget management. i'm currently reading `Dollars and Sense` by Dan Ariely and a book on Bitcoin to get initiated. Once i feel confident, i'll start building an investment portfolio with the goal of 2Xing my savings in a shorter timeframe than it took me to get to X. i'm planning to start a side-business with the aim of generating passive income that can support me in the future. i'm open to exploring non-tech ideas and currently researching one in the e-commerce industry. i plan to get regular on producing the Early Twenties podcasts, and aim to do 12 of them in '21.

Inspired by Joe Rogan, i've decided to explore martial arts. i'm heading out for a Muay Thai class tomorrow evening, and will be trying out JiuJitsu soon. The idea is to get stronger while maintaining my current workout routine(which includes a cumulative of 50 kilometers run in a month + weight training thrice a week). Flexibility is a prerequisite when it comes to MMA, and i plan to include yoga routines in the morning. In the past few months, i've started setting weight training goals and i'll continue doing that on my monthly check-in blogs. i'm terrible at managing my sleep routine, and this year i plan to include sleep tracking in my checkins. i've not focused on meditation in 2020, and efforts in the past to remediate this have failed - i'm not going to force this on myself, and i'm going to meditate if i feel like it(probably not cut out for me). On the sexual health side, i plan to continue my nofap streaks and completely abstain unless i feel otherwise(currently i'm on Day 58 of my 100-day target).

i've started reading more in the last quarter of '20, and i aim to continue this habit. i will be doing monthly visits to the National Library, and get at least 30 minutes of reading on a daily basis. i plan to maintain balance in my social life, and the current long-distance relationship is helping me achieve it - i'm not distracted and much more focused because of this balance. i aim to push more commitment here, and have a problem-solving attitude rather than a problem-avoiding attitude when it comes to maintaining the relationship.

Routines: i've noticed shifts in my work output on days when i ease into my work in the mornings, and that's why i'm introducing morning yoga/run sessions. Again inspired by Joe Rogan, i'm gonna implement 'Post and Ghost' when it comes to social media usage - i'll just be posting Instagram updates of my daily workouts, and check out after. My evening routine is not ideal for reflection or thinking, and i plan to cut out all YouTube/podcasts after 8PM - the idea is to limit junk content consumption which ideally happens in the night over dinner.

That's a wrap on the resolutions. Now, moving on to a quick recap of the last week!

It was a 4-day workweek, and much of it is a blur after this long weekend. Did some planning for the next sprint, and getting ready for tasks in Q1. The new year party was good fun(although new years never live up to the hype!), as i returned to my bed at 4:30 in the AM. Hit all workouts except the weekend run, as it rained almost the entirety of the last couple days. NoFap becomes difficult on days when i don't workout - so it's imperative for me to stay on the log. Nike Run Club says that i clocked 631.7 kilometers in '20, quite a bad performance compared to the 1000K i promised on the Early Twenties podcast a year ago. i visited the River Safari for a quick outing this Saturday - had fun watching the pandas eat leaves and sleep away. i was blown away by the gharial from the Ganges. Nature is weird. Evolution is weirder.

Keep hammerin'
