My weekly report from the 28th of August to the 3rd of September -- a satisfying workweek, barring a Friday night and an unproductive Sunday. 

A thought that's been stuck in my mind, about how productive i actually am -- Gary Vee asks, "What are you doing from Friday 7PM to Monday 7AM?". Probably spending most of it on dumb shit. Gotta triple down on my strengths, and go tunnel *fucking* vision.

A challenge i've been facing lately, is that of balancing work at Myntra, with my personal projects/to-dos. I've realized working on two intensive projects in a single day is kinda tough, with motivation depleting by the end of the day. I should be slotting separate days -- weekends solely for kaggle and data projects, work in the weekdays, and learning-based projects on weekday nights. Don't know how feasible this structure is, will have to experiment. But clearly, concentrating on two jupyter notebooks at the same time is not happening.

I worked on the Web Traffic competition Friday through Sunday -- made good progress on feature engineering and building an abstracted data pipeline. Incremental progress, should yield some positive results. This competition has not been encouraging looking at the leaderboard -- probably because of the time-series based project, and 'n' number of challenges with data pipeling, missing values, and memory issues! 

At work, i spent 2-3 days on understanding the concepts of co-clustering, bi-clustering, k-means cluster 'goodness' and applying them on my user-vectors. The results are not very satisfactory as of now, will be increasing my dataset size and retesting. Otherwise, i'll be moving back to more traditional clustering techniques like k-means for the sake of speed. Should have a working prototype by end of September -- daunting! I also attended a team demo, which was particularly interesting to me -- an AI-algo to greenchannel genuine returns in the context of Myntra's logistics platform. It was inspiring how a simple xgboost can affect so many people on-ground! 

Still no work on 'while-my-code-runs', looking like another project in the graveyard. I've begun work on a new dataset, "Fashion-MNIST" -- have some good blog/kernel ideas, plus learning opportunities in the neural nets domain. I have the Indiahacks Finals lined up on Friday and Saturday, will be exciting! 

Talking about excited, the GoPro Hero 5 Session is here! Just waiting for other accessories, raring to take it out for a vlog test. I still don't have a lot of clarity on my "why" behind the weekly vlog project, gotta figure that out. Went for a long run in Cubbon Park on Sunday, put in a nice 5:01 pace 17.5Km blissful/painful run ;) Satara's gonna be insane :) 

That's it folks. Later!
