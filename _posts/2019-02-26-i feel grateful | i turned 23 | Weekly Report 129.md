Welcome to Report #129! i am running low on sleep, but high on gratefulness.

The last couple of days have been wildly different from the usual. i turned 23 over the weekend, and had a total blast of a time! Birthdays are the best time of the year :)

Over the workweek, i failed on most of my timeline goals. Every Monday, we set out a list of feature deployments to be done over the five days. Because of some reason or the other, development got delayed and piggybacked on my backlog. A failure of a week. Lots to execute on this week.

I'm aiming to make big changes on the product front over the week, and delight our customers in the process. But this blog isn't about intentions. Actions over intentions.

Fundraising is a painfully slow process. There are so many moving parts, and hypotheticals fuck with my brain. We have been having product conversations with a lot of people, and have been getting good feedback on possible roads we can take!

This Friday, i went to a BITSian meetup in Robertson Quay and met up with a bunch of batchmates and juniors. Listening to so many different perspectives is quite a refresher, makes you realize that the universe is much bigger than your own little world.

This Saturday, i met up with my uncle and cousins in the afternoon, and ran my longest(fast!) 30 kilometers in the evening at the Marina Run! This has been my first competitive run in around 8 months, and i'm so proud of my effort into this. My upper body didn't co-operate very well, but it just reiterates that i need to spend more time at the gym. Oh, by the way, East Coast Park is so so beautiful in the evening. A runner's paradise!

i finished the run by 9PM on Saturday, and then a bunch of friends celebrated my birthday at 12! We played mafia and poker late into the night, and woke up to head off for more celebrations. 

We spent the evening and night at the Tanjong Beach Club, which reminded me of Arugam Bay! There was this hippy fancy club/restraunt along the beach, along with volleyball courts and pull-up bars for the adventurous. We stuck to playing fun truth/dare games in the sea and the pool! We ended the day with a dinner along Robertson Quay, i spent a couple hours on my bed time travelling inside my head. 

Birthdays are probably the only time i talk to a lot of older friends, and that makes me kinda weird in my brain. it started on my Saturday long run, but i started feeling very grateful for where i am. For the last 3 years, i have been writing an e-mail to myself that gets delivered on my next birthday. These e-mails make me smile. Very short-lived though -- i freaked out with my backlog as soon as Monday came!

Talking about friends, we released a fresh episode of the Early Twenties podcast! Funnily enough, we talk about friendships :)

On the fitness front, this wasn't a great one. i injured my left shoulder while bench-pressing, and that just got aggravated in the long run. Took a rest day before the long run, and hence, i couldn't put in my Back & Biceps workout. Not too worried about it though, i'll be back soon.

Long post! Thokte raho? :)
