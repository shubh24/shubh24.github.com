Welcome, boys & girls, to a rare occurence on this blog, a biweekly report! Not proud of it, but it is what it is. Skipped last week's report due to an intense weekend where i was fighting timelines to push out features to production! i made it a point to take time out for this week's report on a Saturday night :)

Not to brag or complain, but the last couple weeks have been very productive and tiring. We made some major changes to our tech architecture, making a set of microservices real-time. We had to undo a lot of code that was written in haste(to push out features fast but required quite some manual intervention). We're now moving towards automation, and consequently, the ability to handle scale.

We are making good progress on our sales pipeline, but wont be sharing a lot about it on this blog. i took quite a few hiring calls over the last couple weeks, to kick off the hunt for the first employees. It isn't easy, but we're learning and modifying our hiring methodology on the fly.

We had hired a freelancer to help transition our frontend framework to ReactJS and we've now taken over the project of a complete makeover of the product! This project made us take some difficult prioritization and resource allocation decisions, but they had to be taken.

About my reading habit, i have gone back to "The Black Swan" by Taleb -- i really like the book, and dont know why i put it down in the first place. Trying to make a conscious effort to sneak in some reading time in the mornings.

On the Early Twenties podcast, we released a Joe Rogan-style podcast last week, with Gargi Sharma as the guest! #SunoSuno

With that episode, our podcast moved into its early twenties! We have now taken the decision to double down on our content and restrict ourselves to one-two episodes per month. We'll be following Derek Siver's "Hell Yes or No" decision taking methodology to decide on possible guests for the podcast.

In my previous blog, I had talked about starting an experiment on Twitter, where i put out a tweet about my day everyday. The main takeaway of the experiment has been a forced lookback every twentyfour hours, and reflect about the day at a meta level. It has been fun, it is now becoming a habit where i think about the day while i'm brushing my teeth before heading to the bed. 

On the fitness front, the last two weeks have been pretty strong. i'm proud of the fact that i didn't miss any run/workout despite having a hard work schedule -- sometimes the workouts are the things that help me hold my sanity! Hope i wake up in time for tomorrow morning's run :)

Cya!
