The weekly report from the 30th of January to the 5th of January -- a week which didn't see good development on side projects. Slacking away at my goals...

At work, i refined the user experience of the Shiny app -- developing UI. Read some good pieces on data democratization and dashboard experiences. My new project is really exciting, leaning more on the side of insight-driven hypotheses -- Customer Journey Analytics via time-series clustering. I'm currently reading up on ideas and techniques, data extraction is a major challenge in itself. Attended a couple of Analytics meetings, the company townhall and a comic show at work!

I came upon a new dataset released by Quora, based on recognizing duplicate questions. It's a really interesting problem, i did some preliminary research and put out an informative [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh24/d/quora/question-pairs-dataset/everything-you-wanna-know). Tried playing a bit with FiveThirtyEight's football dataset, but gave in midway :(

The paragraphs on side-projects have really gone down in the past few weeks -- it's probably a side effect of the internship. Bloody excuses. I should utilise my 7PM to 12AM time more productively :/

I ramped up on the Nike training workouts, and did a 6k speed run at Cubbon. Also, I made my clay court debut -- a solid 90 minute 3-setter with Aniket! 

Till next time!
