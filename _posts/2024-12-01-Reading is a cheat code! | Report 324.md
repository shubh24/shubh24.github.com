Welcome to 324, can't believe it's December already. i was reflecting on the vision document i'd written late December last year, and i was happy to see how i've come through on my goals. 

Without a goal, you can't score. When i lookback, it's funny how all the details are unknown and unpredictable, but the overall story arc is somehow honored. Gives me the confidence to aim higher at a longer time frame, and trust myself to get there.

Have been reading Seneca's letters, and it's complete bonkers how relevant some of these texts are. We try to find meaning & purpose in all kinds of places, scrolling, wandering, but it's all written down by someone much much smarter. Sometimes i feel the post-modern world has convinced us to believe that we are the superior advanced version of humans, but in actuality, we're no different than the Romans. Humans haven't changed much, and the core tenets stay the same. Reading is hence, a cheat code.

It was Thanksgiving this week, and i thought i should express my gratitude to the universe! Thankful to Anukshi and our relationship over the last 3 years, it's been one of those central things around which everything revolves. Thankful to my family & friends, for those are unconditional pillars of support i can lean on when the going gets tough. And lastly, thankful to the teams who designed and deployed language-models, for these are going to be drivers of the economy for the foreseeable future. 

On the fitness front, i went through an interesting mindset shift. Till recently, i would hit the gym and be happy that i hit the gym, and the goal was to just hit the weights/hit a certain number on the weighing scale. However, recently, i've started to pay more attention to each gym session and analyzing my "performance". Whether i'm getting better at each lift, whether the last night's rest is impacting the session, whether the isolated muscle is going thru failure. Never knew lifting heavy things would become such a big part of my life, but i'm happy it did :))

Keep hammerin'
