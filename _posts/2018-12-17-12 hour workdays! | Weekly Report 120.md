`There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week -- Elon Musk`

This was a controversial tweet that Elon had posted a while back, but if there is something on the internet that truly resonates with me, it's that tweet.

Oh, and welcome to a review of Week 120!

The past week was as intense as it could get, as we inched towards a demo-able MVP. I spent the past weekend putting in two 12-hour days on the desk -- making the frontend talk to the backend, and making both of them talk to the NLP engine. 

A while back, I used to be disheartened if my efforts went in vain if the idea or product got invalidated. Now, I love the grunt, the process -- irrespective.

Elon followed his tweet with another one. `But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnâ€™t feel like work`

Over the last week, we showed our Airtable demo to a few customers and our mentors at EF. We also went over our Financial projections, building out the deck week by week. We had our first government meeting too, exciting times :)

I went out for a Friday night after a long time, celebrating Sid's farewell at Clarke Quay. I gotta run along that route :p

On the fitness front, i'm not satisfied with my efforts this week. Missed my weekend long run, under the excuse of work. Apart from that, put in two runs & three workouts. I tried out Pilates for the first time, and really liked the back stability it works on. Have included it in my post-run cooldown ritual :)

So, that's that. Back on the grind. But first, I gotta run :)
