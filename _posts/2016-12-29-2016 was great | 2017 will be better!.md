Six months ago, I began blogging with the singular purpose of keeping my productivity in check. I write weekly reports of whatever I have been upto!

This is a Mega 52-Week Special Edition! Here's my year in review, and what I want to achieve in 2017!

**Twenty Sixteen**

i began running, everyday. January mornings in Pilani were ruthless!

i started microjournalling. A page of my day, everyday.

i* worked on many side-projects -- [Revmine](http://bit.ly/revmine), [Monica](https://github.com/Zephrys/monica/), [Wolfe](https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/wolfe), [RecoBot](https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/recobot), [Bro](https://github.com/zephrys/bro), [Musique](https://github.com/Zephrys/musique), and a lot many failed ones! 

i turned 20. 

i* made a Chrome Extension which bagged the 4th Prize in a National level hackathon(Indiahacks).

my tennis team toured delhi, we won the tournament at NLU. The team got super drunk, it was crazy!

i wore a suit to the [Batch Snaps](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1756795451207241.100006304091387&type=3), good times ;)

i interned at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Bangalore. It was good, Bangalore was better!

i* made [BirbalBot](https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/birbal) and [TrumpCat](https://github.com/shubh24/Trump-Detect). 

i started this blog. i made [CaseyBot](https://github.com/shubh24/casey-compile).

i sat for campus placements. i got [placed](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/roadmap/2016/08/18/placed-at-myntra.html).

i bought a [skateboard](http://www.amazon.in/Hawk-Senior-Bat-31x8-inch-Orange/dp/B00I2NE5QC?). Getting better at it!

i went to mcleodganj, himachal. [i trekked the Triund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa9Boku69Qw). Visited the Dharamsala cricket stadium, twice! 

i participated in quite a few Kaggle competitions. i put out three [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh24). A lot of scope for improvement!

i trained for BOSM, i didnt play. We won the silver. My last BOSM :(

i had ten shikanjis in an hour, just for fun -- Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHd67FtmkdE)!

i bought a new phone. someone stole my new phone. i bought the same phone again!

i went to nepal. [i trekked Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpzV3cymauk) at 4130 metres above sea level. Was it tough? You bet!

i wanted hillary to win. trump won. I wrote a [blog](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2016/11/12/The-science-behind-Election-Polls-Trump-Vs-Clinton.html) on it.

i and gyani snooped on DC++ search queries. Here's my [analysis](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2016/12/04/What-I-learnt-from-snooping-on-DC++!.html).

i made a [Shiny app](https://shubh24.shinyapps.io/shiny_ipl/) -- Batsmen Analytics in IPL!

i climbed up the clock tower in Pilani. It was beautiful! 

i* bought a toy drone, broke the toy drone. Twice!

i ran. i ran more.

i ran 21 km along the Carters' road, my first half-marathon. It was fun!

i left college. [Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niW2jgtWPWA).

i am home. home is bliss.

**Twenty Seventeen**

The next six months in Bangalore will be productive, no compromises. 

I've failed at my 2016 goal to rank within the top 10% of a Kaggle Competition. 2017 will witness that.

I'm going to work on my fitness, seriously -- alternate runs and workouts, 3 days each! I've registered for my second half-marathon in Pondicherry! It's gonna be fun! 

I'm going to read more, and consume less. 

I want to do more with this platform -- Consistent quality blogs to a bigger audience. Tim Urban is my inspiration!

Do subscribe to the weekly newsletter, hope you didn't kill the popup :)
