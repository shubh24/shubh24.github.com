My weekly report - from the 18th of July to the 24th of July. This week went too fast -- I feel life's moving too fast. Slow down and appreciate the sunsets. Slow the hell down!

Good development on Birbal -- A basic Telegram bot is ready with simple functionalities. It still needs to be iterated over and over, we want to understand more use cases and remodel the bot accordingly. I enjoyed the process of thinking about the core of our algorithm i.e. how ratings would be quantified and how specific features would be evaluated. Thanks to [@gyani](https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y), the Flipkart scraper and the Telegram bot are working well.    

I've been practicing competitive coding a little more seriously, but I'm still not at the level I'd expected myself to be going into the placements. There is still a week to go, and I intend to polish up on theory and coding skills.

Went to a farewell lunch, organized by my team at BBQ Nation! It was good fun -- had an awesome lunch! I gave a good farewell speech, I hope! Review for BBQ - 8/10 (my teammates were disappointed they didn't serve booze :p) 

This weekend, I went on a trek with [Dhruv](https://www.facebook.com/dhruvgoel2295),[Kshitij](https://www.facebook.com/kshitij.agarwal.1422) and [Shambhavi](https://www.facebook.com/shambhavi.mehrotra.3) to Nandi Hills, 60 kms from Bangalore. It was a really fun day, though the trek was overwhelmed by the travel! Hung out in Koramangala in the evening -- a complete blog/vlog coming soon!

Progress has been rather slow on the Kaggle competition. I haven't been prioritizing it at the top of my to-do lists recently. I don't think the coming week would also be conducive to do a one or two-day Data Science workout. 

I'll be leaving Bangalore in the night today -- expect an internship round-up blog soon!
