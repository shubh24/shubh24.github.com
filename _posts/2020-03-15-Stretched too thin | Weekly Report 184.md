Welcome to 184!

This week was quite a rollercoaster - it is so important for me to keep documenting in these blogs, it's so easy to lose track of all that's going on. 

This Monday, i felt stretched when work took a little too much out of me - balancing client issues, hiring, planning, and day-to-day development has not been easy. However, a good night's sleep seemed to cure things as i was back on the track. Need to make some changes to how tasks are delegated.

A couple months back, i had started chunking my working time into timeslots so that i could focus on one thing at a time - however it's been difficult to follow because things are quite unpredictable. That sounds like an excuse, and i probably can improve how i manage my time - have been reading a bit about how to separate out scrum, engineering management and product management.

It was Holi this Tuesday, haven't been home for Holi for two years now. However i headed out to my uncle's place for dinner, and also showed the kids a few card tricks i've learnt recently! Have been chewing on some sweets this week, not good.

Coronavirus has taken up crazy proportions of our collective headspace off-late, and i've been consumed by news coming in. Listened in to the JRE & TimFerris episodes about the virus to get some good quality information, a lot still left to unfold in the world. Listening to Jack Kornfield talk about mortality reminds me of the stoic way of thinking about life, the fear these epidemics induce in us are just reminders of our mere mortality. It's important to stay close to the mortal nature of life. 

This week wasn't good on the fitness front - the night workouts haven't been happening, combine that with 10AM reporting times at the office and everything goes out the window. i put in a Friday workout and a 5K run on Saturday, and that's been it. Hopeful of turning it around.

The weekend has been good - on Saturday, i slept for 10 hours and worked for 6, just like all Saturdays. Sunday has been productive - did a lunch meeting, and have been writing emails and this blog for the past couple hours. 

Keep hammerin'
