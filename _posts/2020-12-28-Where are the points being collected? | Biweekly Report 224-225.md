Welcome to 224/225. Today, i was on my weekend run listening to Coach Bennett on Nike Run Club - and Coach was talking about celebrating the starting of the run. When we start a run when we don't want to, we collect extra points, but the bigger question is who is counting these points and how do we redeem these points? Self satisfaction is the ultimate leaderboard in life. Money, likes and followers are fake leaderboards - leading to imitation tactics and groupthink. As long as i feel proud of my actions, i know i'm on the right track. As Coach always says, this is about running and this is not about running. i love runs which lead to these kind of thoughts.

Last week, i got hooked to a banger from MC Stan - this guy is rewriting the rules of Desi hip-hop. Just say Amin!

At work, i had a mixed couple weeks - we got some good validation on the product and direction in which we're heading, but got bogged down by development demands. i lagged behind my targets on backend dev. Spent a fair amount of time on infra work for deployment of a new service. While writing this blog, i realized that one problem i have is not spending enough time reflecting on all conversations/meetings we had in the last week - that could lead to better decision-making and delegation from my side. i've actively tried to restrict laptop screen time during the weekends, and that is causing delays on my weekend to-do lists - meaning i need to reprioritize my lists.

On the sleep front, i had a mixed bag yet again. Embarassed to admit, but many nights are still ending at 3AM, and i'm running on six hours of sleep on many weekdays. The odd days where i sleep for eight hours, i'm singing songs and generally feel happier - it's an attractive tradeoff but i'm unable to achieve it on a consistent basis. My weekends are often 10+ hours of sleep to recover. i think i need to invest in some structure to track this better - currently, i just log my wake-up times but don't use this data anyhow. Probably those sleep tracking devices.

This last quarter, i borrowed and returned two books from the National Library('Games Primates play' and 'Option B'). I've gotten four new books, will update more with learnings here. i'm getting back on a regular reading habit, and i'm very proud of this!

Last weekend, we released a new episode on the Early Twenties with Anirudh Singla(CEO of Pepper) - inspiring episode, do listen!

Accountability log on NoFap: currently on Day 52, feeling strong. i've realized that i feel urges on days when i miss my workouts and have residual energy running through the body. 

i feel good with my current fitness levels: although i'm not putting in long runs, i'm continuing with regular runs/workouts or tennis sessions. i did a Rovo tennis session last Saturday, and massaged my sore shoulder for two straight days afterwards - i'm now integrating at least one tennis session every week. Yesterday, i went out for a squash session after two years and i still had the touch - squash is such a fun sport, i regret not having played it in college. Meh, no ragrets.

My full marathon plans won't be fulfilled, but i'll instead be focussing on weight goals at the gym. i've been seeing improvements since i've started to define my lift goals week-by-week. Once things are written down, the weak bitch in my head has no option but to comply. Accountability log: i missed a leg workout this week.

The weekends have been solid at maintaining balance. This weekend, i went out to the library, visited a natural life museum(saw huge dinosaur models & got disgusted by weird animal fossils), and also met up a bunch of friends over lunch & dinner. Have been catching up on reading on the weekends. i'd like to move the needle slightly to get more work done during the weekends also - no judgements though, balance is always a non-achievable utopia.

There's still a few days left in the year! Keep hammerin'
