Welcome to 266!

The week started off strong with long discussions around what we are building at work, quite important as we go heads-down into execution mode. i spent a bunch of my time looking at the data community and contributing myself via Slack/Github. Had a 100% in-person demo followed by a team dinner on Friday evening to cap things off for the week. Having fun, to say the least!

i've been thinking about the concept that energy & mood gives the mind and body the right setting to reach out for ideas. If i never ran 10K, i would never dream of running a marathon, the right ideas originate from a source of energy. If there's been no morning workout and i start off on low energy, then i'm not as productive and not in flow mode - that's why i shall continue tinkering on the energy optimization problem.

On the fitness front, i put in two runs, 3 gym workouts and fairly consistent with abs/stretching sessions. Ran a 19K long run on Sunday, and started feeling it in the knees towards the last couple kilometers -- don't think that i'm in the right shape for the 30K Ooty run in April!

The weekend was restful, had a late Friday night but got back on the log with a morning session at the gym. Spent a large part of the Sunday morning at Cubbon running around, saw huge lines outside Chinnaswamy as India faced off Lanka in a day-night test match! Visited Blossom's after a good couple years, and got me a few new books. Spent a fair chunk of the weekend setting the routine and agenda for the week, and also got started with daily planning on Sunsama - loving it so far.

Keep hammerin'
