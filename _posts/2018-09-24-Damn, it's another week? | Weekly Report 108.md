Welcome to Week 108, another one in the books. Inching towards the 3-month checkpoint at EF, it's getting tense by the day.

Sometimes, when i'm overwhelmed with work i'm reminded of a song by Tom Rosenthal.

Don't you know how busy & important i am? I've got so much to do.
Ask me for a dinner on a Friday night, i've got too much to do.
Maybe i'm just trying to distract myself from my mortality.

Anyway, being the existentialist i am, i should focus on what i can do. Over the past week, we pushed for traction -- getting some positive responses, and hopeful for closures within the next week.

We headed out to the Deep Tech Summit(organized at Marina Bay!), a good status check on current market trends. Also, headed up to CeLaVi post the conference and brainstormed -- one check off the Singapore Bucketlist! Also attended a conference of emerging tech within legal & compliance, another good check on the market situation. 

I started work on building a front-end for our product, and got a basic prototype working. Ran into quite some issues with deploying the webpack nodejs project, learning everything the hard way. Have some more changes to be executed on the frontend -- have put it on the backburner. Gotta prioritize ruthlessly. 

We pitched at the EF stage this Friday on our team-idea edge fit, i could've done better. Give me a GoPro and i'll rip the video shot, but microphones are not my thing XD

We have been running into trust issues with potential customers -- firstly we are talking about an AI assistant that will take decisions based on a black box, and secondly how do you trust a startup! Listened to a great podcast on The Tim Ferris Show -- with Daniel Ek(Spotify). Some great insights on how you can hack trust at scale. 

On the fitness front, i put in my three runs and two workouts -- happy with the efforts. People tell me i should have more fun, i tell them i run. Isn't that fun enough? Strange.

Put in a couple journalling sessions, hoping to make this a habit. I've also started another of my nonsensical streaks -- One Instagram Story everyday. C'mon it's fun!

Also, we visited a Bollywood Dance bar this Friday. Well that was a first XD

Later :)
