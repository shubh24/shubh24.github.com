My weekly report - from the 7th of November to the 13th of November. I'm still not working as much as I'd like to, time is flying by! Zoom out -- Just a month left before I leave college. Wow!

Work on Terminal-AI took off earlier in the week, but has stagnated currently. Modules for setting reminders and managing to-do lists have been written. Also, HackerNews' terminal version is integrated in the system, now I can listen to my news on my terminal! Lots to be done this week.

Donald J. Trump is the President-elect of the United States -- this is as worrying as it is laughable! My friends and me were glued to the internet on the election day, following the developments. Bitten by the election fever, I decided to go all-in and write a blog on the ["Science behind Election Polls"](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2016/11/12/The-science-behind-Election-Polls-Trump-Vs-Clinton.html). Took two full days to research and the existing polling methodologies!  

I'm beginning to like "Data Journalism", inspired a whole lot by FiveThirtyEight! It's really interesting to see how different people can weave different stories with the same set of data. I'm also working on a side-project(DC_Analytics) -- it aims to understand what BITS Pilani is searching by it's intranet searches (on DC++). How the time of the day, hostel or gender are influencing our searches. Expect a blog soon! 

This week, I touched the 10 KM mark, completing it in 56:03! The aim for this week is to continue this streak, and stretch to 12 K.

Have quite a few vlog ideas, which I aim to realize this week! Visiting "Glider's Club" is also on the bucket-list!

That's all folks!
