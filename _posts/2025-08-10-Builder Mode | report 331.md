Report 331, writing this as the clock strikes 12 to another Monday! 

The last week was so energetic, i feel like i'm really enjoying life when i'm in builder mode. Ideas come flashing, and importantly, i have the time and space to try them out! Building also takes you on a journey of its own - things don't work, they somewhat work, they break again, and then they finally work. There is some beauty to that process, which is inherently fun.

GPT-5 was released this past thursday, and that was another trip of excitement and anticipation. So much to learn from these last 3 years -- as a new technology emerged and nobody knew where it'd lead to, but now things are becoming a bit more predictable and certain. There's probably similar patterns in every new wave, and i'm so happy i was able to live and actively learn through this one. 

Fitness has been so much better this week - i hit 3 gym workouts and 1 jiujitsu session, but very bummed that there were 3 rest days. My workout timings are still not disciplined, and i hope i can get to some consistency this week. 

My sister visited us over this weekend, and we celebrated Rakhi with a bunch of our siblings and cousins here in SF. We vacationed around the city quite a bit and somehow these vacations tire me out more than regular days. 

Gonna be a fun week coming up, i wanna ship a bunch of new ideas i've been thinking about. Keep hammerin'
