My report from the 27th of February to the 5th of March -- a productive week, on the back of a couple! Progress is made on Renthop, i'm currently working on a kernel as well.

I was getting stuck on my model, over the first 3-4 days of the week. I could see the validation score increasing, but the leaderboard didn't see any progress. It hit me on Friday, there was a leakage in the model -- Managers of validation were being used in calculating "manager score" of the training. Also, removing "building score" from the features turned out for the good -- Probably, the testing dataset is different from the training. I'm currently building more features, experimenting, i'm not gonna give up on this one! I've also begun playing with a kaggle dataset on McDonald's menu details -- a kernel is due! 

I'm gonna begin work on the RNN project(the one side project which dies along the way...)! Image captioning is already solved, thanks to CaptionBot by Microsoft. I'm thinking of stacking an RNN over the caption(as a seed), to generate paraphrases -- The RNNs can be trained over different personalities, which might give differently styled paragraphs. A cheap "style transfer", maybe!

Going strong on the workouts, i've begun the "Lean Fit" program on NTC -- Yuss! Tried to go for a run, the knee is still pretty bad. I've begun meditating 10 minutes a day(via the Headspace app), a simple experiment to practice mindfulness. Let's see!
 
I've got two books on my table right now -- "Thinking, fast and slow" and "The Pragmatic Programmer". Building the habit -- Read more. Consume less.

That's pretty much it, i've been really engrossed in the competition. Break into the top 10%!
