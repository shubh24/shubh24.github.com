Welcome back, it has been a while! This report might be biased by recency bias, but i'll try to cram in everything that happened over the past couple of weeks.

First of all, & most importantly, we graduated out of our incubator Entrepreneur First! We're in the midst of a crazy fundraising schedule as i write this blog. 

Over the last week, we went through EF's Demo Day and followed it up with a roadshow with potential investors. It was an intense experience -- going through rehearsals & green rooms, watching CEOs lose their shit over every word in the pitch, and showcasing our product to investor after investor. 

The week before Demo Day was all about getting the product to a presentable version, just focussing on the value proposition & making it as pretty as possible. There were a bunch of pitch writing workshops, and deliberations on crafting the story sexily. 

We did the pitch in front of EF alumni, friends & family last Monday, and then redid the whole thing in front of over 300 investors on Tuesday. We then set up our booth and networked, for as long as my legs gave me strength! 

The next day, we got back in the grind again -- switching into fundraising mode, the first investor meetings have been super exciting! Lots to learn :)

I've gotten back into product dev, and we're now getting the product into a usable form for our paid pilots commencing soon! The deadlines stress me out from time to time, bugs give me the chills in my sleep! But i've realized over & over again that stressing does no good. Just gotta put the head down, and execute.

Over the last couple weeks, we put out two guest episodes of the Early Twenties podcast, one centered around Prioritization with Devanshi, and the other one was a little more free-handed & conversational. Go give them a listen!

These podcasts have become one of my major destressers of late :)

On the fitness front, the last two weeks have been pretty strong. Took one day off on the Demo Day, but otherwise satisfied. Haven't gone on the scheduled 30K run yet, instead substituted it for shorter 10-milers. Soon!

i recently watched the Australian Open finals, and it rekindled my love for tennis. I really wanna get back on court, i'll be figuring something soon :)

So that's that, i am rushing out for my Monday recovery run now. Later!
