Weekly report from the 19th of December to the 25th of December. Merry Christmas everyone! Improvement from the previous weeks, in terms of productivity :)

This week, I played around with a new [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedagntmulder/serialhomicideoffenderdata) on Homicide Offenders, and pushed out a kernel -- "[Suspects and Motives](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh24/d/fedagntmulder/serialhomicideoffenderdata/motives-and-weapons)" -- A lot more can be achieved. I'm also beginning work on a Kaggle Competition -- [Santa's Uncertain Bags](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santas-uncertain-bags), will be exciting!

Over the weekend, I got support for the mailing list ready on this blog, and added a "Hire Me" to the front page. Plans for 2017 are big -- Build a audience, and push quality content consistently.

My attempts at building a GAN have led to dismal failures :( With no clear headways, it has taken a backseat. Work will resume in the coming days.

I've rebooted my running schedule, am building up the miles from scratch. My next goal is to improve speed on the Half Marathon -- I'm registering for the famous Auroville Marathon(12th of Feb). Hope to complete the race in 1:45 hours. Also, I'll begin weight training in 2017, there's a first time to everything!

Bought a Chromecast 2.0 for the home LCD -- been spending a lot of time on YouTube ;)

That's all folks!
