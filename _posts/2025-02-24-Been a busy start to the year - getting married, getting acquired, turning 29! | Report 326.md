Welcome to 326! 

It's been almost two months since my last blog, but there are legitimate reasons for my leave of absence. There's been a lot of changes in life recently, and i'll use this blog to capture the high-level updates. Deeper dives are reserved for the next few blogs. 

i got married to Anukshi at a courthouse in San Jose! One fine Tuesday, i asked GPT what's the easiest way for us to get married, and on Friday, we exchanged our vows. Couldn't be happier :))

Our startup, [Houseware, was acquired by LaunchDarkly](https://www.houseware.io/blog/houseware-joins-launchdarkly-a-new-chapter-begins). These last few years have been a great ride and it's so gratifying to see it come to a successful culmination.

i've now moved to San Francisco, currently writing this blog from Rincon Hill. This is the one place in the whole world where i feel like my energy matches the city's energy the best. Earlier in 2024, i'd received my O-1 visa and that has helped me make the move. 

i turned 29 today, but i feel younger than ever. Yesterday, i was surfing at the Pacifica, and today, i was rolling at the Ralph Gracie BJJ academy. Pumped that i've gotten regular with JiuJitsu now, and intend to keep getting better every week. 

There's a lot more that happened in the last couple months, but in the interest of getting this blog live, i'll keep it short. More to follow. 

Keep hammerin'
