Welcome to a fairly delayed report on Week #137. Not a great week in terms of visible output, but super-helpful in doing a reset for the sake of long-term productivity.

The week started off with quite a few work-from-homes, where i fell into a weird sleep routine, sleeping at 4AM and waking up at 12PM consistently. We chugged along the development, but not as fast as I'd like. i had to deliver a few features for a product demo earlier in the week, which took precedence over other tasks, and introduced some context switching to go back to the original plan.

Made quite a few dinner trips to my uncle's place here in Singapore, and had to do a couple chores distracting me from work.

On Thursday night, i flew to Calcutta, watched the sun rise over a Masala Tea kulhad and then flew to Bombay to surprise my Mom and sister! Spent the long weekend at home, and went out on Sunday night for my parents' anniversary dinner :)

I was missing the rickshaw, and hence dedicated the entire Bombay trip to it -- travelled from Chembur to Powai, to Bandra, and back -- met up with a couple seniors, go-karted, and watched IPL in a Singapore bar!

The long flights helped me flip through the masterclass by Harari, "Sapiens" -- expect a comprehensive review soon. This will be first step towards the New Years' Resolution to write a book review blog every month!

Over the weekend, we released a 'guestless' episode of the Early Twenties Podcast -- where the three of us discussed work-life balance! i spent quite a lot of time making Instagram posts and stories from our account, publicizing the previous episode -- got really positive feedback :) #SunoSuno

On the fitness front, I put in three runs and two workouts -- had to skip 'Biceps Day' because of a slight niggle in my ankle. Rested it, and ran a five miler over the weekend -- i was so happy and nostalgic running along the familiar grounds where i used to play cricket and football as a teenager. Emotions are quite an alien feeling to me.

Okay, cya next week. Keep hammerin'
