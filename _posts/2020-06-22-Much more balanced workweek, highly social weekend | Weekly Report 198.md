Welcome to 198.

Writing this on late Monday night, the sleep cycle stays the same!

The last week was much more balanced when it comes to breaking down my day into work time and non-work time. Product trials make things exciting, add a deploy Friday and the to-do lists become tough to handle. i'm struggling to keep up with long-term thinking, and haven't been able to focus on retrospectives off-late. Need to get back on the track.

On the fitness front, i put in 3 runs including a riverside 10K after almost a month. i put in two short workouts, skipped one on Thursday feeling terrible the whole of Friday. Not exercising can have cascaded effects. 

Singapore has now entered into Phase 2 of Unlock from the coronavirus lockdown, which means i can now start hitting the gym! i had lunch from Jaggi's for the first time in over two months, and also got myself a pair of dumbbells & a skipping rope just in case everything closes down again.

Celebrated the unlock by hanging out with a couple friends and watched 'Khosla ka Ghosla' after more than 10 years! Recorded and published a guest episode of the Early Twenties podcast, chatted up with college friends on Saturday for a birthday, did a virtual run with a senior on Sunday, and listened to a lot of kr$na. A highly social weekend after a long time, one where i did not bog myself down with work.

In the last weekly report, i'd promised that i'd learn how to cook chicken and i did so indeed! Worked with chicken breast & drumsticks, was a lot of effort but had fun - i'll be making this a regular over the weeks. Need to be careful with cooking the chicken thoughly, not very happy with the digestion.

Over the weekend, i had so much to do on the work side & non-work commitments, realized that the only way to manage this is with discipline on the calendar. i can't be taking any off-hours even on the weekends. Discipline equals freedom.
