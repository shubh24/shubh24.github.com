#328. Been close to a quarter since i penned the last blog entry, but glad i'm getting back on the slate. 

At work, our team announced the General Availability of the "Product Analytics" product under the LaunchDarkly ecosystem in May. Post-acquisition, my main goal was to ensure that the Houseware product and team get completely integrated within LaunchDarkly, and over the last few months, we accomplished that goal. i even spent 1.5 months back in India, working with the team, working towards our GA launch, and it was so fulfilling to be back where it all started!

As i was reflecting on the post-acquisition integration, i wondered what was the highest leverage next thing for my team to be growing into, and for me to be working on. i spoke to a ton of companies across the vertical AI stack (from models to infra to application layer), trying to evaluate how & where could i further build my specific knowledge. i felt like my team @ LaunchDarkly was well-placed to lead and grow independently, and i took a gut call to transition out. it wasn't easy at first to decide, but in some ways, when i removed all the noise to focus on what truly matters, it was a straightforward decision

As they say, tummy never lies.

For the last week, i was on a break between jobs and we visited New Mexico to visit family. Such a different and beautiful place, i really liked the Pueblo architecture! Will talk more about my next stint in the next blog report.

On the side, i have so many ideas that i keep thinking/vibe-coding just for the fun of it. i know these explorations and tangents would lead to something big in the years to come. One that's front and center is a concept of exploring ideas and concepts in a curated personalized fashion, very much like how museums are curated to teach you about specific ideas.

The world's been really going topsy-turvy with all the mini-wars(Ind-Pak in May and Israel-Iran in June) and the Trump-brokered ceasefires. Thank god for those ceasefires, because i have a tendency to fall into the twitter-doomsday trap for those weeks, monitoring the situation as they say. Not very good, need to maintain agency and focus on what i can control.

One piece of good news that came through recently was that my EB-1A application got approved, and that means i'm in the queue for the Green Card. One step closer. How long would the queue take, who knows, but at least i got the approval secured.

Travelled quite a bit in the last few months. Spent a considerable amount of time in India(across Bangalore, Bombay, Udaipur), and then also made a quick pit-stop in Spain for Anukshi's MBA graduation. Also travelled to Seville for a weekend and learnt about the Moor influence in Europe, i never knew!

Anukshi's in US these days, and it's so much fun to live life with her everyday. In long-distance, you talk about the same things, but somehow being in the same space, experiencing life together makes that much more enriching. We also moved into a new apartment in SF recently, and it's such a nice experience to set up life together!

On the fitness front, things have been very patchy. Not heading to the gym as regularly as i should. But on the other hand, i started going out for tennis and a few runs in SF recently, that's fun! Also received a stripe on the white belt from Professor Rhalan Gracie at the recent grading that happened at our JiuJitsu gym :))

Been tweeting a lot more, nice outlet to document ideas/shower thoughts. i like this one in particular ;)

Have been fiddling around with the UI of this website recently, keen to ship out the refreshed look very soon!

Keep hammerin'
