*Every goodbye will lead to a hello! -- Shubhankar Srivastava* XD

I got on a call with a handful of folks from my EF cohort, still figuring out the cofounder conundrum! Also met up with a few guys from the cohort in Indiranagar, chatted about ideas and industries over dinner. Smart and humble people! 

I've realized that i don't need to consider this as a competition, take it as it comes. Take it a little easy, and extract the max out of this process. 

Caught up with quite a few friends over the weekend, and sneaked in a tennis and squash session too!

Put out a couple vlogs over this week.

704 went on a Sunday road trip to Hogenakkal waterfalls in Tamil Nadu. My fourth trip to TN since I've come to BLR! Made a vlog :)

Fitness and diet has slowed down over the past week, which i'm not happy about. Could only put in 3 out of the 6 planned sessions, i have to get back on track. 

Also, June was terrible in terms of my journal & meditation practice -- only put in 9 out of 30 days. I dont want to fall back on the excuse of a dynamic morning routine over the past month, good habits shouldn't be compromised. 

Woah, this blog took me quite some time. Later!
