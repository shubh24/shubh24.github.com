Welcome, boys & girls, ladies & germs, to Week 114 of my bloglife! 

This week was a vacation-ish week, one where i got frustrated with not being working enough. We were waiting for the funding results from our startup incubator(Entrepreneur First), and thus decided to take a few days off. 

We went through an intense panel interview on Monday -- we were grilled thoroughly on our defensibility & differentiation. The whole exercise was a good experience to learn about the thought process of investors & the fundraising process. 

By Friday evening, we were informed of our selection amongst the 16 teams funded by EF for this cohort. This was a pre-seed round, and takes us to Demo Day in January -- validation in our idea & vision, but the real game starts now. 

We are gonna focus on product dev for the next couple of months, but i'll talk about that in coming blogs. Actions over Intentions.

From Monday to Friday, i chilled out quite a lot -- chilling doesn't come natural to me. Roamed around East Coast Park for 12 hours, took my GoPro for repair, edited a couple of Lanka vlogs, pulled in a long Poker night & put in some intense gym sessions!

On the fitness front, another sucessful week - didn't stick to my routine very well though. I should be prioritizing discipline to workouts over every other commitment, otherwise it's very easy to fall behind schedule. The workouts were tough, it was hard keeping my hands stable after the bicep day haha! Put in a pacy 10-miler earlier today(Sunday), fun long run :)

Bid adieu to October -- patting my back for the consistent journal+meditation streak throughout. Have set two goals for November -- waking up before 8AM & putting in a reading session for 20 out of the 30 days. 

That's it folks, later lah!
