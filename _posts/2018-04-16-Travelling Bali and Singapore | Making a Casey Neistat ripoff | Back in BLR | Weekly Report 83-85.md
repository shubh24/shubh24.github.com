A 3-week report from the 27th of March to 15th of April -- a good couple weeks off work, feel ready-as-ever to get back on track!

On the 29th of March, i headed out to Bali with the intention to start a daily vlog series. For 7 days! The week flew by really fast, visited a few temples, biked through Bali, ran along an island, saw one of the bluest blue lagoons, and surfed on the Kuta beach! Made 6 vlogs, and headed out to Singapore. Ran by the Marina Bay, visited Universal Studios, dined in Clarke Quay, had a lot of fun with my cousins. Shot some footage, but couldn't make a comprehendable vlog-worthy story out of it. Back in Bangalore on the 13th of April. 

Casey Neistat started his daily vlog series, 368. I watched the first episode, i remade the first episode. A ripoff. Spent the weekend shooting, editing, and then marketing the video, optimistic about the view count!

Gonna refocus on focal.ai from this week, regular development, regular standups, regular practice. #JitnaDutyUtnaPractice

On the fitness front, i have been getting those runs in despite all the travel. Gotta get back on the workouts and skate sessions! Diet needs a rehaul, might visit a dietician within the coming weeks.

That's it folks, a minor update blog. Later.
