Welcome to Week 149. 

A consistent theme in my mind over the last 7-10 days has been about becoming more organized around how i structure my time & work. i have been writing out my weekly goals lately, and it has helped me visualize what i need to do on a daily basis. i also spent some time on our product roadmap and thought about structuring our sprints in a better way.

On the personal front, i have been actively trying to bring my go-to-bed time to around 12AM. i have been fairly successful at that, but my wake-up time is still not up there. The ultimate goal is to run/workout everyday first thing in the morning. It will have to be a gradual process, and will require lots of discipline to shut down my screens around 11PM. In this pursuit, i gave up my Monday & Wednesday night run as well, not at all happy about it.

We spent most of our time on an important feature sprint, as i chipped away at our backend models. Also making some progress on the Data Science side, lots to be done on that front! 

Have been thinking a bit about 'working hard', and how it has gotten trending nowadays -- it really contradicts my worldview but it's something i have been stuck upon. It made me quetion my work style. Sometimes not listening to people is the answer.

i happened to go out exploring Clarke Quay nightlife on a Tuesday night with a few relatives, felt nice to chill out for a few hours. Unplanned outings are fun. Over the weekend we put an episode of the Early Twenties Podcast, you can call it S2E1!

On the fitness front, this week hasn't been great. i hope my night run sacrifices work towards me developing the morning habit(i did put in an afternoon Chest Day!). This Saturday, i kayaked for the first time in my life -- it's a really good workout for my arms & core. Was fun pushing against the waves, was even more fun putting my legs up and chilling out in the kayak in the middle of the Kallang river!

Okay, keep hammerin'
