Welcome to 211. i was running a 10K earlier today, listening to Lex Fridman & Joe Rogan talk about how beautiful life is. i couldn't agree more, just the fact that i can experience so many emotions in a day without worrying much about the future makes me feel fortunate. A good run, followed by a bath and some chicken puts me in a great mood :)

Work was solid this week as i continued my focus on the product - writing PRDs, sprint retros, lubricating the engineering machine. My afternoon work sessions were much better than last week but i could've handled my evening workout timings better. We also did a team meet on Wednesday in Telok Ayer over lunch, and i sat in a couple external meetings later in the week.

We released an episode on the Early Twenties podcast this week - give it a listen!

On the fitness front, i put in my three runs, one gym workout but substituted Thursday's & Friday's gym sessions with quick home workouts on NTC. Didn't feel as strong on the weekend 10K, need to continue my focus on nutrition.

On some nights, everything is super busy with back to back non-work calls post dinner. That's not great to unwind as well, need to protect my me time. i went out on a date this weekend, it's fun going out of the comfort zone and challenging yourself. Balance outside work helps me focus better on work as everything else is taken care of.

Chennai Super Kings kicked it off with a win, so excited about the IPL this year. Need to figure out how i'll watch it though XD

Okay, need to catch some sleep and get back on the grind. Keep hammerin'
