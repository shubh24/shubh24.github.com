3, 2, 1, welcome to 321!

This blog has now seen three presidential elections since 2016, and DJT has been involved in all three. What a time to be alive. Well-deserved landslide victory for MAGA, and i could feel the optimism and enthusiasm on-ground even in SF!

Seemed like the whole country was watching this closely, it's so interesting to watch large groups of people participate in something so abstract like democracy. This whole concept of governing countries and having governments baffles me sometimes, how does this all even work at such a scale!

Over the last year or so, as i visited Rome and learnt about Roman history, and also parallely watched how the Silicon Valley got activated with the 2024 elections, it made me wonder of my role in politics as well. Not now, but a few decades down the road. Romans used to have a fascinating life arc, where one single person would fight in war in his youth, build businesses in mid-life, and then work in government in the latter half of his life. It does seem counter-intuitive, but when i think about it, it is probably a high-leverage way to create value and build upon life experiences to create an N(1) impact.

Anyway, the world i live in is very optimistic right now, me included. i turned on NBC for the laughs, and it is clear a large part of the people have a very different worldview. i guess that is how things will be. We created the internet and thought we'll personalize our shopping apps, ended up personalizing perceived realities.

Work's been stressful, but i've tried to detach myself from outcome-driven thinking to keep things grounded. Shuttled across engg/infra/all kinds of work, happy with the rate of change of progress. Every week, it becomes more and more apparent how important of a skill decision-making  is. Too much to unwrap, will write about this in detail on a future blog!

Hit a bunch of new spots in SF: explored different parts of GG-Park last weekend with my sister, walked through a few night parties this week on Market/4th & Chinatown, went up the Coit Tower for a breathtaking sunset, walked along Sausalito and took the ferry back to SF earlier this morning!

i realized staying in US vs Europe is a huge difference from the perspective of a muse. Europe evokes wonder, America evokes inspiration. Everything good in Europe was built by aristocracy/nobility a hundred years ago and is non-relatable. Everything in the States is built by someone you follow on Twitter, and i can clearly see which path takes me there. Displays of riches in Europe are beautiful palaces and monuments, while displays of riches in US are yachts and beautiful houses. Clearly, US/ACC, EU/DEACC.

On the fitness front, i hit 6/7 days at the gym last week. Not going all-out with the workouts, but still happy with the effort i'm putting in. In maintenance mode right now with my workouts, will hit the throttle in the second half of November.

Keep hammerin'
