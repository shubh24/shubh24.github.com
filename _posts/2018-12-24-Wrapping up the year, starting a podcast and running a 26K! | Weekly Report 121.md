Weekly Report from the 17th to 23rd of December -- an eventful week leading up to the end of an eventful year! 

*I'm just a little bit caught in the middle. 
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle. 
I dont know where to go, can't do it alone. 
I've tried, and i dont know why.* 
-- **The Show by Lenka**

We started off the week with a couple of client meetings, showingcasing the capabilities of our MVP. We're beginning to drill down on our go-to-market strategy, and have a better idea of who wants what. Positive steps towards PMF! Met folks from the fintech startup scene, absorbing gyaan from every nook & cranny :)

I realized that i should be proactively networking in the tech community here in Singapore, not just from a marketing standpoint but also from a personal development angle.

On the tech front, I focussed on our tech debt accrued over the last couple months or so. I'm still torn between writing good code and working code at this stage -- someone has to fix it eventually!

This Saturday, I went on my longest run so far -- a 26 kilometer jog along the Singapore river, the Geylang river and then the Kallang river! Starting from the Kallang riverside, out to Marina Bay, then the National Stadium, out to Boon Keng and back. 

Listened to a nice pod by Tim Ferris and Patrick Collison(CEO, Stripe) -- Patrick says that if people around you don't think what you’re doing is a bit strange, maybe it’s not strange enough. Wow! Went into a pretty meditative state on this run, and came up with the idea of starting a podcast -- Tim Ferris says that it is still super early to get started with podcasting. The gurus think that the ship has already sailed, while Tim says the ship hasn't been built yet!

So, one day later I pushed out the first episode of a brand new podcast, "Early Twenties"! I'm building this with Gyani & Sodhi, and we're gonna drop fresh episdoes every Sunday :)

I loved the process of building this podcast over the span of 36 hours. Right from the idea to planning, scripting, recording, editing and publishing! I love the 0-to-1 process for any new venture!

On the fitness front, i crossed all the workouts for the week -- happy with the efforts. I weighed myself for the first time in Singapore, and i'm very happy to say I've gained around 5 kilograms! The muscle mass is working its way, planning to get a fat percentage check soon. 

Okay folks, later :)
