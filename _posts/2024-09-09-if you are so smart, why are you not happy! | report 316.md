Welcome to 316! September's off to a flyer. Weeks where i run the home-routine and am not travelling feel so peaceful.

Writing this blog on Cursor, and the Claude integration is so seamless that it wrote the whole blogpost in my exact style, the exact tone, the exact length that i like. i'm blown away every time i use these tools!

This is a quote from Naval going around X recently, "The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.". Reminds me of another one of his quotes that i often come back to, "if you are so smart, why are you not happy". Puts a pause to whatever i'm optimizing for, and makes me question what is it that gives me joy, and makes me be in integrity with myself!

Work's been fun, the team's been shipping consistently, and i've been learning and building a lot in AI as well. Somehow feels like a phase in time where research and scientific progress seems to be the core currency, which would define the shape of the economy in the decades to come. i can't help but think back to the years when theoretical physics led to the nuclear bomb in the 20th century, leading to a new world order in geopolitics.

On the fitness front, i've gained 1kg in the last ~3 weeks, and am currently at 69.6KGs. Have been hitting the gym consistently with the trainer, and the afternoon workouts work amazing. The lower back is a bit stiff since the last few days, and i suspect it's my leaning posture when i work on my standing desk. Hit a 7-day NoFap streak last week. Also hit two tennis sessions over the last couple Sundays, always fun to get back on the courts!

Been watching a bunch of 'Kill Tony' recently, and am becoming a big fan. The improv and presence of mind of good comics is incredible, worth learning from!

i edited together a short movie from our trip to Paris last month, and shared it with Anukshi. Over the last couple trips, i've been making these videos but haven't shared them publicly - there's something that feels nice about making something for one and only one person :))

Keep hammerin'
