Welcome to 278!

Work was fun this week, moved a bunch of things on-ground to get to the desired end state by end of week. Pulled in a late night, but realized that early morning chaos is not worth it. Off late, i've been working at home for the first half and heading to work post-lunch, helps me get a good chunk of time to focus! The days & nights are constantly yoyo-ing, but i'm fairly used to the yoyos by now. Need to be more mindful about the Interface on the daily, internally & externally - all while trusting my gut. Realized that the idea/theme of work keeps changing and what actually would matter is the people we work with -- should index more on this!

On the fitness front, i put in three short runs, two workouts at the gym, 1 ab session and an involuntary rest day on Friday. Rating: Can be better.

Life is on Hard Mode, but it's pretty much on Cruise Control. Turbo Mode needs to be activated, i can't get complacent. Need to shake things up with rewards and penalties. 

Discipline based changes:
 - Rs.500 penalty everyday if i don't wake up by 7AM
 - Rs.500 penalty everyday if <30 minutes of reading/learning per day - starting out with Extreme Ownership & a video series by Jeff Weiner
 - Every Weekend: Work blog, similar to this one, but focused more on our focus, positioning, product and team.
 - 3 BJJ sessions per week
 - 20 min stretching routine daily in the morning

Q3 Fitness Goals:
 - Squat: 50KG X 12 reps
 - Bench Press: 50KG X 12 reps
 - Deadlift: 40KG X 12 reps
 - Hammer Curl: 20KG X 12 reps
 - Monthly Mileage: 40KM

The last two weeks have been good on nutrition as i got a top-notch cook solve this for me! Almost all meals are now home-cooked. i hurt my arm while parking my bicycle and feel like i need some extra calcium to repair this sucker.

Stability with Anukshi has helped me put the relationship in cruise control, and go turbo mode everywhere else. We have established a zoom-out ritual that helps us communicate better and practice gratitude. How you do anything is how you do everything.

Gonna cook some chicken dinner now - keep hammerin'
