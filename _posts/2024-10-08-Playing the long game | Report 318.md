Welcome to 318, can't believe we're in Q4 already!

A good few weeks spent in San Francisco, based out of NoPa, working from Montgomery. Bunch of learnings that have brewed from reflections and a constant habit of journalling recently. 

Work's been fun, we've been navigating the different agentic use cases in marketing teams, and launching these in a PLG fashion. One of our launches landed #6 on ProductHunt's list this last weekend! 

San Francisco is a place where i truly feel the best, the energy of the people is infectious! One of these Fridays, a bunch of us headed to the SFFC(Freedom Party), what a brilliant get-together of minds! Also spent one of the Saturdays at a hardware hackathon, building a transcription+agentic use case on a necklace form factor. Ended up winning the hackathon, but it was primarily my partner's original codebase that did the heavylifting! Attended the OpenAI DevDay party, saw Sam Altman and Greg Brockman irl, it was quite an evening. The whole world feels so small and warm when you're in the right place! 

Also visited my sister in Los Angeles over a weekend - walked along the Hollywood, and laughed the night away at the Comedy Store(thanks Rogan!). Saw way too many overdosed folks in the city, not a good look, hope things get better!

Back in Bangalore with the team now, looking forward to get back in the routine. Weight stayed consistent at 69.5kg, looking to bump it up by 1+kg in the next 3 weeks.

One of the biggest learnings from the last 6-7 years of building startups: persistence is key. Need to keep on going on. Keep hammerinâ€™!
