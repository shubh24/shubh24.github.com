Welcome to the blog, been some time since the last post!

The last few weeks have been difficult, as i fought the clock for deploys and monsters in my head for sanity. Got the `curl up in the bed` feeling that seasoned businessmen often talk about, but i'm confident i'll be fine soon. The last sprint had a good bunch of learnings for the dev team, and i need to get back to writing my team emails to document this. Although we've gotten better at documentation, i realized there's still a long way to go.

One thing i'm not happy about is the time estimation we're doing for development related tasks. Had to pull in a few all-nighters and an entire weekend, and the sleep pattern went for a toss for a week. The thing i talked about in the last blog - about not being able to straddle product and project, is still something i need to improve on. Product feels like a lot of fluff, but it's a different beast altogether. Lot of doubts nagging in my head, i'll fight them through and then share more here. The gratefulness thingy that people talk about, need to get that going - not very sure how that works.

i attended a Founder Communication Workshop organized by SGI a couple weeks ago, that was a good reminder. We've started Friday team meetups which are good facetime opportunities. Listened to Tim Ferris talk to Daniel Ek from Spotify recently, which re-emphasized the importance of managing time on a day-to-day, matching it to your monthly and quarterly goals. Also, i realized that there's a full backlog of Tim Ferris episodes i need to catch up on - so much to do!

Talking about podcasts, we released a previously recorded episode with Abhishek Gupta from Navgurukul and also recorded another one recently(due for deploy). Interesting episode, do listen!

On the fitness front, i've been consistent and the workload has not affected the routine as yet. Till last week, i had weight-based goals with different exercises, need to prepare goals for the next six weeks. Went for an afternoon long run this Saturday and wandered around Marina South Pier, my first time there! i've started to feel guilty if i take some extra time out for long runs - maybe i can spend the time better planning out my week. Long runs take a lot out of the weekend, need to plan them better. i also played tennis recently with a bunch of friends, i'll start out playing on Rovo from January onwards. My achilles is giving some trouble, gonna take it a little easy on the runs this week.

i'm currently on Day 38 of NoFap - on track for a century. 

Went out for a couple dinners last week to meet a bunch of friends, good conversations to take my mind off work for sometime. Also visited uncle's place to get some good Indian food a week back. My family had visited our hometown for a wedding, giving me an itsy-bitsy amount of fomo - Singapore seems to be getting the covid vaccine soon, so travelling might not be a distant dream anymore. i've been in a long-distance relationship for over a month now, and things seem to be working out for now. It's not easy, but if it were wouldn't everyone do it.

Keep hammerin'
