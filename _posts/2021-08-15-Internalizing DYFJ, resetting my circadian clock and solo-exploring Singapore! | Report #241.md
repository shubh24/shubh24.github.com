Welcome to #241

"Money comes and goes, but time only goes" -- B. Jeffrey Madoff

It's been a couple weeks of ups & downs at work - we've seen good uptake of our product by users, and can see our expected outcomes translating slowly. Now, it's a question of how fast we can increase this growth, and race against time. Fundraising, user feedback, external voices telling us how to go about building the business - all of these external factors can take a decent toll on the mind, but if i am to be truly stoic, i shall control my reaction towards the external factors as that is the only controllable. Scott Belsky's mantra(D.Y.F.J) is helping me out to maintain productivity through the days amidst the unpredictables.

On the development side, i've been focusing on enhancing our no-code app builder, making it as no-code as possible with external integrations and editable configurations. However, i saw OpenAI's release of Codex which dwarfs my attempt at building no-code tools. This serves as a warning sign to all software developers. Artificial Intelligence is coming for all of us, and it's coming fast.

i've been listening to Dr.Huberman a decent bit, and for the last 7 days i've stuck to a healthy circadian rhythym. i've slept by 12-12:30AM and woken up by 7:30AM in order to get a morning workout in, followed by a cold shower and only then begin my work. The morning sunlight definitely helps kick the lethargy out of the body. Another consequence is that i am forced to give up my evening YouTube time, as i have to wrap up work and get into bed sooner.

This discipline has helped me stick to DYFJ, and not let my mind wander. Anxiety is just time wasted worrying, and i need to stick to a stricter discipline especially in hard times.

On the fitness front, things have been thankfully running smoothly. i started doing yoga sessions at the park nearby in the mornings, and it's quite some fun to see kids run & play around. i've run 36 kilometers in August so far, including a 15K earlier today to celebrate the 15th August(IDay!). i hit the gym a couple times this week, as the lockdown restrictions eased up - i've now started logging details of the weight lifted in each workout to keep a track of my progress. At BJJ, we have been working on the half-guard position, and it's a lot of fun to see the small details taught in drills actually work when we live spar.

For the last two weekends, i've been taking days off and really explore Singapore by going out in the city. Last Saturday, i took out my pennyboard and roamed around Clarke Quay and Esplanade Park - sat around and read a book in a park that afternoon. This Sunday, i headed out to Changi Beach Park in the North-East, and explored the beauty of this island. Sometimes, i feel like i've landed in a tropical holiday spot - the diversity in this small country blows my mind. Solo travel has been good for the soul, as it helps me take my mind off work for a day or so.

Last Saturday, i experimented with fasting and didn't have any food(except a few almonds) till 8PM in the night which amounted to about 20 hours of no food. i was out skateboarding for hours in the afternoon and even that didn't cause any issues in my cardio. There was just some hunger cravings, but very manageable. Something i'll be experimenting with much more in the future. This Friday, i went to a birthday party to my uncle's place and ate enough sugar for an year. Time to get back on the line.

Keep hammerin'
