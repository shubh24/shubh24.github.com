Welcome to #260!

Started off the week strong with an onboarding in the team, and then later meeting up with everyone at the Bangalore office! Spent some time on the arch for the backend systems, and coded up an Auth service. Brain muscles were engaged as we brainstormed on the product vision.

i moved back to Bangalore on Wednesday night, these Bombay to Bangalore flights now feel like such a standard commute as i can do door-to-door under six hours. Getting back into routine helped me focus my energy better at work, also spent some time resetting my whiteboard and goals for the coming quarter. Solitude and independence are important for creativity, and i shall maintain a personal space/studio for the rest of my life. Gives me a sense of control and structure in the sub-conscious mind.

On the fitness front, i put in three runs including a 10K at Cubbon earlier today! Separately, i put in 1 gym workout, 2 NTC home workouts and 4 stretching workouts this week. Aiming to get back to BJJ classes from this week onwards, it's been a very long break now. Broke the nofap streak somewhere around Day 15, currently on Day 2.

Changing the day-to-day every once in a while makes me cognizant of how easy life can get. A hot water shower and a good office chair can numb us to how great of luxuries these are. i ride my bicycle to work, but on traffic signals i see beggar kids ogling at the bike as if it were a UFO spaceship. Life's not fair, i'll keep playing the hand i got. Keep hammerin'
