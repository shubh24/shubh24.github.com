Week 106. Writing these reports is a great exercise to lookback and see how far we've come in one week :)

We went out for more meetings, and spent quite a lot of time brainstorming and charting out the solution bit. Also went through an exercise in guesstimating the servicable market size - was helpful in getting an idea of work that lies ahead. At EF, the whole of the cohort had to do an elevator pitch, another good exercise in distilling your idea to the core.

We went to a conference in Compliance, wore a shirt and trousers! Set up more meetings for the week ahead, still lots to be done. I started work on our landing page over the weekend, plan to launch it mid-week. 

I continued my completely non-sensical goal to run everyday. As of this Sunday, I was at 14 runs in 14 days -- it is physically harmful for my fitness, did it anyways! Gonna take a rest day and get back on the hedonistic adrenaline treadmill :)

Haven't been sleeping really well, but sneaked in a couple journal entries and a meditation session too! Gotta make it regular, save myself from a burnout. 

Apologies for the late post, haven't been on a human routine of late. Later!
