My weekly report from the 2nd of October to the 8th of October -- a rather busy week at work, but haven't been focussed on making my weeknights productive lately. 

**Deadlines make me productive -- Casey Neistat**

At work, i've been learning and building on my project at my pace, slowly. "First week of October" was the deadline for segmented sort, and i've managed to get my first cut ready -- with our hypotheses confirmed. I've become comfortable with managing the Java codebase, running MR jobs and iterating over my algorithm. Put in a couple of long evenings at work too! We should launch an A/B test on the first cut sometime this week, hopefully :) 

My upcoming projects are really exciting -- using MLR(Learning to Rank) algorithms to develop our sort order, and taking a dab at the RTO(return to origin) problem. New problems, will be start work on them by this week :)

I have spent *zero* time on Kaggle this week, no weeknights spent on personal projects. Clearly not where i wanna be. 

I spent two whole days editing the Hampi vlog, this was a massive project! Striving to be a better storyteller. Every week.

Don't have a clear idea of my next movie, will have to come up with an idea asap! Probably a book review blog on Rafael Nadal's biograhy -- provided i complete it!

On the fitness front, i put in three days of gymming this week. i shouldn't be taking off-days, especially in the early stages! Put in a short blissful 4k run on Saturday, not putting a lot of strain on my knees. Worth mentioning, the audio coached workouts on Nike Run Club are really motivating! Give it a try if you're just getting into running.

Yeah, that's it! Later :)
