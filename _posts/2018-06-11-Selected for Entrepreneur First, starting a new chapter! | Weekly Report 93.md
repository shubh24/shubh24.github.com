A weekly report of my week, from the 4th of June to the 10th of June '18. I resigned from my job. I am choosing my trap. Before someone chooses mine.

I made a vlog about it.

A subscriber commented, "The biggest risk is not taking any risk". I couldn't have put it better.

I haven't been more excited and scared in my life. My colleagues are huddled near me talking about something that doesn't matter. Maybe the chick flick they watched last weekend, or the best pub in Indiranagar. Maybe nothing matters in life, but that shit definitely doesn't.

I want to build something that matters. Something that will outlive me. Something that will count as my legacy. Tall claims, taller ambitions. 

I'll be moving to Singapore by end of July, as a cohort member of EFSG4. I'm currently reading up on a lot of startup resources, going through various podcasts and figuring out a compatible co-founder from my cohort. 

There's a lot on the plate, there's nothing on the plate. 

Everything hurts. Nothing hurts.

Its all perspective. 

Later.

PS: My week went fine, hit all fitness goals, put in a 22K run. Will be back with the regular blog soon.
