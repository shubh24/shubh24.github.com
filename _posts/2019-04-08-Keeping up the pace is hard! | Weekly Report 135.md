This is One Three Five!

The last week was heavy on product development, but we couldn't get a lot of deployments through. In the earlier stages of a startup, you can assume best-case development scenarios to work well -- but with growing baggage, both in code and backlog, it can soon turn into worst-case scenarios.

I tried setting up a serverless service for a real-time application, and making it talk with our APIs -- but after spending the better part of the week on that, i realized AWS Lambda doesn't offer certain multiprocessing functionalities. We now need to change the tech stack altogether. Good learnings however, `zappa` is super cool!

We restarted our intern drive again, to bolster our development efforts on a bunch of new ideas -- slowly starting to think about full-time hiring too. Read in a blog that there will always be bugs to fix and fires to put out, don't make hiring your temporary fix -- especially in the early stages that we are in. 

As i had mentioned in the previous blog, i have started a time-tracking habit to log every activity of mine throughout the day. I use an app called [TickTok](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.finlabs.timetracker) for this, and it has been weirdly fun so far! The core objective of this exercise is to collect enough data on my time-spending habits to run a Machine Learning model and find what patterns make me productive. Not normal, i know!

Over the weekend, we recorded a podcast with Nirant Kasliwal, i spent better parts of my sleeping quota editing this one, and put it out on Sunday. Suno suno!

On the fitness front, i did well with sticking to the schedule despite a Monday run miss. I have been spending around 90 minutes in the gym every session, and foam rolling is now part of the routine! Pretty good with the meditation practice too -- i recently finished a Headspace Pro pack, which contains eerily silent guided meditation sessions. A very cool insight i stumbled upon was how we fool our own minds with our own thoughts during meditation, it's almost as if there are two minds playing when you take an observer's point of view!

i also started reading Sapiens, which has been on the stack for quite a while. Just one chapter in, the reading had me hooked -- i'll probably run this one really fast!

Okay folks, time for the Monday run. Cya!
