Welcome to another biweekly report on the blog. No real excuse for missing it last time round, i could've worked on it on the last weekend but procrastinated beyond repair.

The last two weeks have been a regression to the mean after our full-speed sprint towards hackathon submission in August, as i focused more on the daily ops of the current sprint and planning for our upcoming big experiments. i worked on PRDs, thought/negotiated on timelines with the team, and also looked deeper into our tech debt/backlog stack to plan for the next couple months. My mornings and evenings are dictated heavily by my calendar, and afternoon/late night are the times i get to do individual work - need to manage & protect my me time better. i've noticed i'm two completely different people in the morning vs evening - and need to improve how i start my mornings to optimize for better decision making and standups. There were some issues to handle on the team side, and a fair amount of bandwidth was consumed on that front too.

To write this report, i was just thinking about the last two weeks and time seems to be running away very quickly. It's gonna be close to one year since i first visited Bangalore to setup our co-working setup and do the initial interviews. Glad i do this lookback on the weekends, was also reminded by a team member of a vlod i'd made in 2018 about documenting my life. Feels good to see a day in my life from two years ago. Talking about vlogs, Casey has uploaded three vlogs in the last three days - this is a big deal, and we might be looking at Casey's second inning! 

i've been reading Meditations on and off, as a reminder to stay on the track. Everytime i read a few pages, i get the sense that i need to stick to the 'nature of how things are' - taking away any uncontrollables from my thinking. i've been playing some chess online after watching a fair bit of Samay Raina recently - i can get addicted to things very quickly, and chess is a dangerous territory where i can literally spent 3 hours staring at the screen. i need to be careful with new hobbies. 

On the fitness front, i've started going out for runs/workouts in the middle of the work day so that my evening/night routine doesn't extend way past midnight. i took two rest days this weekend because i wasn't feeling it. Put in two runs, one gym workout and two home workouts this week, and hit all six sessions last week(including a 12K tempo run!). Not too concerned about the rest days, i shall be back on the track from tomorrow. One thing i definitely need to work on is prepare six-week plans and do goal-setting around my fitness. This has been on the list of to-dos for a while now, i should research and get started on it this week.

This weekend had a very contrasting look to it - Saturday was super-busy with an Early Twenties recording, a viewing of Tenet in the theatres and a consequent mindfuck, and a call with a few data scientists in the morning. Went out on a housewarming party on Friday night, watched the 2005 classic 'Garam Masala', and had a lot of fun. The Lunchclub meetings have been turned out to be a good investment, as i managed to setup the follow-up discussion with data scientists this weekend. Sunday has been good, is a weird feeling of relief to wake up without the thoughts of getting on video calls. As an update on the nofap streak, i relapsed on Day 20 of my second attempt, and am currently on Day 5 of the third attempt. 

Good report, keep hammerin'
