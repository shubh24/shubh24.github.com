Hello December! Another week heavy on Product Dev, UI Design & running around!

We started the week with trashing out our initial UX ideas, based on a prototype built out on Airtable. We then came up with new ideas, passed them by with a designer friend and settled down on building out the backend for it.

Spent quite a lot of time in thinking about the API design at a feature level -- started with defining the resources and functinoalities required. We had a lot of back & forth on which features are implementable, and which features *need* to be in the MVP. 

We met quite a few potential advisors over the week, and demo-ed an early prototype to them. Received a bunch of useful feedback, lots to act upon!

On the fitness front, put in a couple runs and three workouts. I've come to a slight pause because of an injury, and am taking complete rest. i hate rest. Had to postpone my 26K weekend run indefinitely, hopefully i'll be back within a couple of days!

Took the Sunday off, chilled out and caught up on a book that has been on my table for a while now: "Annapurna by Vintage Herzog" - the story of the first ascent up the 8-thousander! 

Back on the grind now, sorry for the late post. Later :)
