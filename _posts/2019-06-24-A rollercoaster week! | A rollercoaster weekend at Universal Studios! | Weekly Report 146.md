Welcome to OneFourSix!

This was a rollercoaster week, as we started off behind certain deadlines - and i was very pissed at myself. Sometimes my defence mechanism is to want to shut out, but i backed myself and worked harder. Days like these teach me how difficult it is to start up.

After fixing the missed deadline issues, we made incremental progress on our dev efforts & also mapped out the roadmap for the short-term future. i tweeted recently that switching between different parts of our tech stack constantly, and switching between planning & execution is what makes my job so much fun for me!

Struggled with a few deployment issues over the later part of the week, and in fact, spent the whole Sunday debugging! Hiring is turning out to be a difficult piece in the puzzle, just like everything else :)

The Twitter streak experiment has been going so far -- forcing me to reflect on everyday & condense the learnings! 49 days in, with one missed day this week.

This Friday, folks from our EF batch met up for a small get-together -- its good to back up and talk with people in the same journey. Many a times when i'm head down programming, i feel like shutting down and partying -- but when i go out, i realize that 'building things' is what i truly enjoy. i need short breaks, not complete resets.

This Saturday, i took a complete off-day and headed off to Universal Studios with a bunch of friends! This was my second time visiting the theme-park, but my first time going on the big rollercoaster -- The Cylon! Had a lot of fun clicking photos, watching theatre, and switching off. We even spent a couple hours at the casino in Sentosa, where i tried my hand at a few games myself -- lost $14, but observed a bunch about human behavior. Taleb & Kahneman don't lie when they talk about human intuition! By the time i was back, i was raring to get back to work haha!

On the fitness front, i realized that my knee still needs some rest. i swapped my leg day for a swim session & missed out on the weekend long run. On the positive side, i put in my first interval workout in more than a month -- Fast is Fun! 

Okay folks, later!
