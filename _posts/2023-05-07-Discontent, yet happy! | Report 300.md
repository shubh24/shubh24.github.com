Welcome to 300. i'm gonna hit a thousand, not too long.

Every week's report starts from a blank page, and it's an exercise in starting from scratch. Gets the wheels running, and then mood follows action.

i remember that in 2018, when i had just dipped my toes into starting up -- someone had asked me what makes a good founder, and i had replied 'persistence'. Moments like those stick in your head somehow, and they carry you through the tough weeks. Persisted through the week and then ended the week with hope and energy, which carried me into the weekend.

On many days, i feel happy and grateful to be doing what i do, and at the same time feel like i have to work so much more for success in life. It's tricky to walk that line between being happy and discontent. Thinking about building a family with Anukshi does have a positive effect here, where the hard work is driven from a vision of our future, and not just personal motivation. Human biology drives the best in humans, wild.

Learning from the week(probably recycling the same from a few weeks earlier): we need to be industrious decision-making machines as founders. Day in, day out. Easy decisions, hard decisions, popular decisions, unpopular decisions - whatever they may be, it's important to trust the gut and keep taking decisions.

On the fitness front, i put in a couple workouts, a couple runs, and one bike+skateboard session in Cubbon. Loving the intensity of the workouts in the mornings nowadays, i feel proud of my effort and gains in the arms now! Just sneaked above 68kgs today, seeking 69 by mid-May. The bummer is that i'm not doing a great job of maintaining a good diet conducive to bulking, and am regressing to the day-to-day. 

Been listening to a few episodes from Mr. Ferriss and digging them. The guy's been producing top-notch content for over a decade, guess what persistence leads to.

Keep hammerin'
