Welcome to 268!

Landed in Bengaluru on early Monday morning, as i reached home showered up to get ready in time for the Monday start! To give my stomach a good rest, i decided to work from home for 3.5 days this week and modified my routine a bit as well. Got in 3-4 hours of deep work before noon, as i skipped morning workouts on a few days. Work was fun as i setup a new backend service, getting multiple moving parts together. Had a good bunch of product discussions, and demo-ed the end state on Friday evening.

i realized that i need to carve out active time for upskilling myself on the weekends, and that's what i did this weekend as well. It's easy to get lost in the day-to-day, but i'll learn and grow better if i focus on this separately.

On the fitness front, i put in two evening gym workouts, 1 10K run on Sunday morning, 1 BJJ sparring session and a couple hours on the tennis courts to end the week. Continued with abs and stretching workouts, although it is clear that i'm nowhere close to six packs or full splits. The microbiome is now fully recovered, and i feel a 100% with my energy levels in the mornings

Weekends nowadays are activity/meetup-based and that makes sure that the routine is in check. Although i wasn't able to devote enough time to the reading list through the week, i made sure that i caught up over the weekend. i'd planned to slot out one hour everyday for learning osmosis, but this hasn't caught on - need to course correct. 

Recently, i've been thinking about Naval's quote: "if you're so smart, why are you not happy?" -- which makes me think a lot about the day-to-day choices around how we invest our time and energy. Many a time, i might go down the short-term gratifying option and choose the option that looks/sounds easy -- however, it might not lead to long-term happiness. For example: in relationships, we should optimize for happiness over a 40-year period and not the next weekend. Sometimes, i might try to rationalize unhapiness in the short-term, and although that might make sense for a few situations, it's probably not the right strategy. pleasure, joy, bliss and ecstasy, in that order.

Keep hammerin'
