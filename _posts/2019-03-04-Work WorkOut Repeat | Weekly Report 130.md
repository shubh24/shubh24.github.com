*Namaste bhaiyon aur beheno!*

Welcome to Week #130 on this blog. Another one lived!

Last week was intense. Do i say that every week? i'm finding new frontiers of work thresholds that i can subject myself to. Sam Altman says that "work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success". i couldn't agree more. The more hours you put in, the better you get. 

Over the past week, we pushed out a couple of major features into production that had been in the backlog for quite a while! i realized that we shouldn't be holding ourselves to hard deadline while talking to customers -- software development is too unpredictable to hold ourselves to dates, especially at the early stage where i'm figuring everything at runtime!

The week included a couple of 11PM nights in the office, and 1AM workouts in the gym. Not a schedule i'm proud of, but i do what it takes to get them in.

Over the course of February, i put in 12 meditation days and 9 journal days, possibly my lowest in a long time. I have seen this pattern repeat itself, when i become successful with a habit for a certain while and then let it go. It's time to reprioritize the mornings and put in a 25-day meditation March!

This week was not successful on fitness goals -- i skipped a Chest/Shoulders Workout to let my shoulder heal and missed my weekend long run. Well, there are no excuses there. Get on track.

This week was good in terms of catching up with friends and their companies! Had a couple dinners together, and went on a hike to the Southern Ridges(and saw the Henderson Waves!) this Sunday. Oh, and my flatmates did an impromptu Clarke Quay trip this Saturday -- had fun, but more importantly, lots of unhealthy food :(

We recorded this week's podcast with Ramsri, my colleague at Entrepreneur First -- and had a blast of an episode! We talked about entrepreneurship, insecurities and Porsches. This episode has gotten the greates amount of hits within the first day of release, excited with where we take *Early Twenties* to. Spent late Saturday night editing this one, editing is funnnnnn!

I have begun to decompress well on weekends in the past month or so, and that is a good sign. I go all out 100 on weekdays and try to switch off on weekends as much as possible. So frickin important. One thing i should improve is getting more sleep on weekends to compensate for the weekdays :p

Okay folks, later!
