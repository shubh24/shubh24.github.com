Welcome to Week #161! 

Thus passes another high velocity week at work - everything's moving so fast, it's become difficult to do a comprehensive recap on weekends. On a meta level, we're moving towards building a better version of our product on all fronts - Design, frontend, data science, & scalability. Not gonna share everything here, but it was quite an intense week as we got good customer validation & made progress on the hiring front.

I've been putting in long 8-10 hours at the office. And these hours are so productive that on some instances i don't even open Instagram the whole day. i make it a point that i decompress on the weekends. My sleep routine has been pretty good over the weekdays, i even managed to sneak in two morning workouts this week, although this blog is being written at 12AM on a Monday! 

i have been reading up on "Meditations" by Marcus Aurellius, and i'm one-third through. it's not an easy book to get through, but sometimes i get really surprised by the wisdom packed in the pages. He's super aware of the mortality of human beings, and that is probably the foundation of stoicism. A lot to read up on!

i made up my marathon training plan for the next 7 weeks, and it feels good to be back on a routine. i sneaked in 5 out of 6 workouts slotted for this week - and that is a great improvement over the last month's numbers. Leg day after so long has sent me into full body pains, but they're the best kind of pains! So proud.

The weekend was pretty easy, got in around 3 hours of work on the Saturday & took the rest of the Sunday easy. My Sunday evening weekend runs are such a good ritual to get the week started - makes me realize where i am in the grand scheme of things, and how nothing matters.

Keep hammerin'
