Welcome to 219.

Wrapped up a sprint this week, one of the more satisfactory sprints in terms of discipline we've concluded in the last few months. i spent the majority of my time in feature and code reviews ensuring every developer is unblocked in their workflow. Started off devops work for a security certification on the product. i tried to wake up at 6ish in the morning, but as soon as i put in some meditation the body's sleep requirements took over and i reverted to my normal wake-up times. i was invited as a guest on an episode of a tech podcast this week, excited to see the final product - will update here.

i've been reading the book 'Games Primates Play', and was learning about dominance in the animal kingdom earlier today. Resource holding Potential & Behavior Potential are interesting concepts that explain the peacocking we engage in social media -- been thinking about this for sometime now, giving me a counter-intuitive explanation that social media is not that bad or removed from evolutionary biology. We're all trying to establish dominance in social relationships via posturing, but probably the scale of online networks is not in line with what humans are used to. Quite an interesting book, i'll try to dive deeper into evolutionary bio - want to maximize my access to the Singapore Library. 

On the fitness front, i've been fialing on meeting long run goals for the 3rd Jan marathon goal. i put in 2 runs this week, 2 gym workouts and one home workout on NTC. Felt stretched after hard workouts on Wednesday's sprint intervals and Thursday's leg day. Need to keep the intensity on 100% for the next 3 months till i hit 42K. i'm currently hovering around 63 kilograms, and aim to hit 66KG by January - today, i spent some time charting out bench/squat/deadlift/curl weight goals that should help me in my journey.

i'm back on the nofap log, currently placed on Day 9. i'd promised a 100 day streak before my 25th birthday on the Early Twenties podcast and this is my only shot at it. it's weird dealing with emotions when it comes to long distance dating, will update here when i have concrete thoughts around it.

It was Diwali weekend this week, and i went on full feast mode. We did a team lunch on Friday at Dempsey, and i consumed a good amount of pasta and ice-cream, following it up with sugar overload on Diwali night at muy uncles' place. Did a poker night on Friday, lost a dollar and then hung out with a bunch of friends on Saturday over lunch. Socializing is tiring, but important to recover from the week. 

Enough reflection, time to get back to hammering.
