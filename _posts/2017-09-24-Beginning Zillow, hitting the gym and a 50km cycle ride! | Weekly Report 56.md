My weekly report from the 18th of September to the 24th of September -- satisfyingly productive at work, not so much at Kaggle. 

I've just begun the [Zillow challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1) on Kaggle -- with just around three weeks to competition deadline, this is GO time! Was reading up on top kernels/discussions, and got started with exploration. I put out my [data blog](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2017/09/10/Predicting-web-traffic-on-Wikipedia-Live-Kaggle-Competition.html) on the WTF competition, felt good! i've secured a Top 30% finish after one week of scoring in the competition, hopeful that a similar position is maintained. Spent the major part of my Saturday reading up on others' approaches to the WTF competition -- i simply feel ashamed at the limits of my efforts and hard work compared to the top achievers. Humbling!

At work, i've made good progress on my project -- my pace is still not good, but i'm learning and getting used to the process. We have a subset of users to run A/B tests on, with their user segments defined -- ran my first Map-Reduce job, that too in Java! i'm also being exposed to new problems(RTO), and the discussions revolving around feature-engg are very exciting. Participating in project-level decisions is a lot of fun too, which problem to solve, how do we go about it, pitting the benefits against the limitations! 

I spent the better part of three weeknights editing the Satara Marathon vlog, editing is a hell lot of work! Have also shot decent footage for the Cubbon docu-vlog, hope it turns out to be a good one!

As promised, i've started gymming post-marathon! Its only been a couple of days, and that too without a concrete training plan. Starting the new week with a trainer, will focus on strengthening my legs and abs -- the ultimate aim is to run faster and longer!

Running is currently stalled, i felt the familiar nagging runners' knee pain when i tried to run a kilometre. Should rest my knees and strengthen my legs, for a month at least. Went for a nice swim with my GoPro -- underwater footage is amazingly clear! Also did a 50KM ride on my *btwin* to Cubbon Park and back! 

Will be going on a trip to Hampi later this week, new travel vlog! Yay! Should be a lot of fun :)

That's it folks! Later.
