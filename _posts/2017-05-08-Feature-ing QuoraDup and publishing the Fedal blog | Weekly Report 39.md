My weekly report from the 1st of May to the 7th of May -- a fairly breadth-focussed week, where i focussed on a lot of projects and never really got into one :/

This week, i seriously got my hands dirty with the Quora challenge! Implemented some common features which gave me a considerable cv jump -- part-of-speech tag match, spacy sentence similarity, frequency of questions, stopwords ratio in question etc. Currently experimenting with the idea of clustering similar questions, its overfitting though! Most likely, a result of generatign the clusters on the basis of our target variable(whether the pair of questions are a duplicate!). I have a feel the order of questions might have a huge impact, will investigate soon :)

At work, i played around a little more with the idea of markov models for churn -- didn't play out very well(documenting my thought process though). I wrote some sql to extract historical health scores, they strangely obeyed staircase plots! Came up with a pretty cool notification scheme for the product, separating the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel strategies. Working on it!

This week, i finished up on the blog on Aus Open Finals' analyis -- [How did Federer beat Nadal?!](https://shubh24.github.io/shubh24.github.com/math/2017/05/07/How-did-Federer-beat-Nadal-Australian-Open-'17.html). Responses still coming in, will mostprobably get a feature on a sports journalism blog soon! The thoughts for porting the analysis into a vlog-like video are on, excited! :)

I've been having a lot of crazy-ass ideas lately, the to-do is exploding. A lot of them on the AI side, on which my experience is not very boastful. Thinking of making an automated Cricket highlights/commentary generator, CaseyTube -- search Casey Neistat vlogs by keywords and a saas product for product managers -- targeted personalized notifications to drive product adoption. Tall orders, execute!

Participated in a hobby day at work, let myself into my infinitesimal creative skills! Learnt sufi calligraphy, mandala art and got a canvas back home too! Felt really good :) I haven't been really good on the reading habit, it's acting so much like a sinusoidal!
