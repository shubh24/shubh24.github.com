Week 115, new beginnings. 

Started the week with working on the product roadmap for our MVP, populating week-by-week tasks on Airtable. It's still not set in stone, and we need to get better at organizing & sharing our todos.

At EF, we went through Launch Week - the introductory week for all teams that got through the Investment Committee. We discussed the roadmap for the next three months, and the ideal state of our product by Demo Day in January. We'll be working on different aspects of our business every week, and build out our investor deck in the process. Traction-wise, we should be in the position of having a bunch of paid pilots and partnerships by then. Fingers crossed :)

We went through a bunch of admin stuff, from incorporating to setting up the bank accounts, setting up our Google Suite & understanding the legal docs for our funds.

Celebrated Diwali by bursting a couple crackers in the rain, eating an insane number of sweets(3), and running at 12 in the night.

We're now working with Gyani on product dev! Spent a day sharing context around our problem, & delegated our tasks accordingly. I observed that having someone work for you is more pressurizing than you working for someone. I have absolutely no excuse to slack off. Working on a couple of really good ideas to get to market as soon as possible.

Over the weekend, we set out working on our tasks independently - getting the productivity back. Slowly. 

On the fitness front, i was able to sneak in all my runs and workouts despite a little skewed schedule. Had to compromise on my weekend long run because of the rains, compensated it by the fastest 9K i've ever run :)

And lah, apologies for the late post. It's been crazy busy nowadays. Later!
