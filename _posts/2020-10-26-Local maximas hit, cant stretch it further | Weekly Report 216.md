Welcome to 216.

i always look up to Casey Neistat's platitude, "Do more" as the guiding principle of everything i do. By the end of this week, i felt that i couldn't go further, i maxed out the juice out of life and that gives me great joy. One day, i won't be able to do this, but i got to do it till i can. There's two kinds of exhaustion - there's one kind where i get tired of what i'm doing and want to put in the towel. And then there's the other kind, the beautiful kind where i sleep within 5 seconds of putting my head on the pillow. i guess i've been listening to a little too much of Lex Fridman lately!

At work, i focused on the current sprint coupled with a few product discussions/negotiations for the coming month. A few blogs ago, i'd written that my role has become more like the oil in the car engine - lately, i feel like my role has more to do with maintaining the pace of the car now. 

i've been using my daily planner(pen & paper) for a couple weeks now, and it's been a major uplift from how i used to manage my to-dos on my phone. It also allows me to reduce the number of times i unlock the phone.

On the fitness front, i put in two runs, two gym workouts and one home workout - missed the weekend long run as my body couldn't continue functinoing and i needed sleep. This is a blow to the marathon training plan, but i'm still positive towards the achieving the set goal.

The weekend was wholesome - i visited the Night Safari on Friday night with a bunch of friends, i hadn't visited since 2018 and i lost it when i saw the lion roar in the wild. The wild is wild. 

i recorded a crazy episode of the Early Twenties podcast on Saturday evening, followed it with some work and a coding class for my sister. i didn't open my laptop screen on Sunday, spent it with friends and family over meals. Had some beef steak sitting around listening to stories - reminded me of how Joe Rogan equates it to the primal feeling of eating your hunt over fire with your tribe. Tribes are weirdly beautiful.

Talking about tribes, i've started reading a book 'Games Primates play', which talks about how humans navigate social situations guided by our animal instincts.

Spent Monday morning planning out the week, lots to do - keep hammerin'
