Welcome to 185. Finishing this blog on a Tuesday night, although i had drafted this out on Saturday evening. 

i've noticed that i'm working hard & putting in the hours, but i'm not putting in quality work on dedicated issues for contiguous hours. Over the course of the last week, i tried chunking my time and that helped me take care of the major tasks - i can still get much better at this. i need to get better at context switching between pairing with my team and working on my individual tasks.

Had a bunch of hiring calls, made quantifiable progress on that front. Did sprint planning for the next quarter, and communicated with the team. Attended an event we co-hosted, had a couple meetings - pretty standard workweek.

Mental strength is so important in leadership, i noticed myself losing temper when i wasn't rested well. If i were just an individual contributor, i could've got away with 4 hours of sleep, but when there's moving parts involved, i need to keep myself calm and handle things with the long-term in mind.ÃŸ

Over the weekend, i consumed infinite coronavirus news and saw myself go into the vortex which is so difficult to get out of. Google searching 'coronavirus' is the first thing when i get up in the morning, and it is the last thing before hitting the bed. Things don't seem to be getting better - personally, the only way to stay out of the negativity is to focus on my work. There doesn't seem to be any travel in the foreseeable future. Was talking to my grandfather on Saturday, and he told me even he hasn't seen anything comparable in his entire life, we're truly living through a unique time.

On the fitness front, i put in four runs(including a 10K on Sunday!). Have noticed slight niggles in my left knee, i'm gonna rest it & limit the runs next week. Put in one bodyweight workout in the gym on Saturday, was quite scared because of the virus - i'm going to avoid the gym from now, and will be putting in bodyweight workouts in the open. Overall, could've been better but good effort!

Sodhi and I recorded a guest episode of the Early Twenties podcast on Saturday evening, was quite some fun. Then post-recording, we kept talking about the coronavirus for about an hour - always good to catch up! Met up with a couple friends on Friday night, danced to a lot of Bollywood videos & witnessed the "Go Corona, Corona go" sensation. 

Okay, getting late now. Stay safe, and keep hammerin'
