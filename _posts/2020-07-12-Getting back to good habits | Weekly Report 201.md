Welcome to Report 201!

At work, i focused on alignment of teams with PRDs(as mentioned in the last report). Lagging a bit on my dev deliverables, as i haven't had well chunked deep work time. i need to improve my productivity over the weekends, the last few weekends have been skewed a little too heavy on rest - the off-days should be spent thinking about long-term about actionables at work. 

This week has been a really good contrast to the last few months in the context of my daily routine. i've been feeling much better during the day with ample sleep in the nights. i've been on the nofap streak(hit the 10-day mark today) - i've noticed a marked improvement in my energy levels when i get out of bed in the mornings. Need to monitor my feelings and emotions during the streak, and make sure i'm not being placebo-ed. i also restarted my meditation habit as a side-effect of the nofap streak. i've been watching a bunch of videos related to the auxiliary habits that can amplify the results of this practice, meditation & exercise being the most important ones.

On the fitness front, i put in six out of six workouts, with two sessions at the gym. i could feel the soreness on the following days, a good sign of progress. i couldn't follow through on the bicep workout at the gym, and sneaked in a quick home workout with the dumbbells. 

Did a potluck(cooked some broccoli salad!) and hung out with a bunch of friends on Friday night, playing Mafia and Undercover(my first time!). Caught up with college friends over a long call on Sunday, and met up with my uncle over dinner. Always good to discuss life plans with older folks, pulls me out of the bubble i live in. Got some clarity around how i should be thinking about liquid cash over the next couple years.

Short report, need to get back on the sleep routine. Keep hammerin'
