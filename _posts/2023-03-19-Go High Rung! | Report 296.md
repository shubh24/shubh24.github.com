Welcome to Report 296, another two week report as we flew by the Ides of March!

While sitting in the sauna earlier today, i realized that i need to get into meditation. My mind is rarely sitting idle, as i'm jumping from one day's to-do list to the other, as the days and nights merge into one. There is too much brain stimulation going around, and a calm mind is a superpower.

Work's been intense - we did a press release about the fundraise, and dealt with the banking crisis in Silicon Valley over the last weekend. This last week has been heavy with customer visits, every day presenting new opportunities and decisions to be made. i'm not sure if i ever say that work's not been intense on these blogs, ha!

Read about 20% of Tim Urban's book on "whats our problem" -- very good mental models to understand humans. Going "High Rung" is something that i've grasped, which means making sure our thoughts are unbiased, our reasoning is scientific and not prey to social or peer pressure. 

Separately, i've become a DAU of OpenAI and have been monitoring the AI trends. i really believe we might be seeing the last generation of software engineers(at least, the way it is defined in 2023!). Super excited, and slightly scared of the future!

Anukshi hasn't been in town for quite a while now, and i've been missing her. i can fill the vaccuum with work, but it's not the same. Really looking forward to seeing her next week! 

My sister had a dengue fever, tested her strength and made her stronger -- it somehow tested me too, how well i deal with such uncertainty and helplessness. i can imagine how people come to believe in God in hard times.

Going good on the bulk, crossed 66kg last week and have been on the upward trend recently. Put in 3 gym sessions each for the last two weeks, topped it with a tennis session earlier today!

The last weekend was spent scrolling through Twitter and understanding the banking fiasco, while this weekend was much more easier on the mind.

Good reflection, time to get back to work. Keep hammerin'
