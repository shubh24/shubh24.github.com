Welcome to Weekly Report #143

Writing this blog late Sunday night, exhausted and at the same time raring to go! This was another six-day workweek -- feels like its a part of me now.

This week was high on anxiety and worries, as we inched closer towards our deadlines and promises. A lot of these worries are imaginative and unwarranted, and i shouldn't be affected by them. For eg. i broke my phone screen first thing on a Monday morning, and was quite unhappy about it the whole day, inadvertently affecting my productivity.

At work, we made progress on the new UI we have been developing, started work on the revamp of our website, and worked on a bunch of backend features to be rolled out in the near future. We onboarded an intern to our engineering team as well.

I took the first half of this Friday off, and then worked my ass over the weekend -- it gets a little tough when you're cracking at it all on your own. But i have to remind myself why i started on this journey, to push myself out of my comfort zone. Everyday.

This week, i realized that i need to be taking a more top-level approach of how we work and not just look at it from the viewpoint of a developer. i need to be taking more strategic decisions that align in the long term.

May was quite a success in terms of my core habits i track. i put in 22 meditation days, 19 days of journalling, and put in six workouts every week, no misses whatsoever! The only place i am lacking is my sleep routine, and wake-up time.

On the fitness front, i'm still recovering from my runners knee. To test things out, i went out for a super-slow recovery run last Monday and realized it is too early to get back on the track. i have started going to the swimming pool instead, and have clocked in two sessions already. The swim habit is beginning to develop, and i'm pretty confident that it is here to stay. i even put in a Cycling+Rowing workout this Wednesday -- bringing variety in the workouts is quite some fun! 

So that was the week! i chilled out for a couple hours earlier this evening, as i chilled alongside the Kallang river listening to some podcasts. Feels good to do a reset sometimes, on to the next one. Keep hammerin'
