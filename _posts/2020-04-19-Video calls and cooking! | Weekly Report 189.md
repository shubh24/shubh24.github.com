Welcome to 189.

Standard workweek, where i focused on security & architecture for a new feature. The days start and end with video calls nowadays, which leads to interstitial time slots for deep thinking. It's a little difficult, but i guess everyone is reinventing how they work.

i've started cooking dinner everyday, which has consumed me - like every other learning curve does. i've begun to like this, and might get addicted soon. However, i've noticed that it takes away a good chunk of time that i would typically spend walking to the restaraunts listening to podcasts or thinking inside my head. i guess it's good and bad - i feel like i don't have enough 'me time' now, but that might change as cooking gets into my muscle memory and becomes meditative. it's taught me a bit of what it means to live on my own, and helped build empathy for people who might be doing this out of necessity everyday. i can draw some rough parallels to the Maslow's hierarchy about how i can focus on higher-value work once i don't have to worry about things like food.

On the fitness front, i put in two short runs, two bodyweight workouts, one foam-roll sesh and one lazy yoga session so far - will be heading out for the weekend run now. Happy with the effort, gotta keep the consistency on point. Haven't been focusing on meditation, journal or reading for quite a few months now - the goal for April is to get back into a Headspace streak. 

Thought a bit about where i was mentally a couple years ago - and whenever i start doing these analyses, i start feeling stupid about my past self. i used to carry a big ego about who i was, probably still do. Anyway, the weekend has been good restoration & decompression - the video calls do take a toll on the mind!

Keep hammerin'
