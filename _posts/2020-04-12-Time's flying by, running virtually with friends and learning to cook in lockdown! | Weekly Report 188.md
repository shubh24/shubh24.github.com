Welcome to 188.

Every weekend, i sit and try to build a narrative to this weekly report - it's usually straightforward as different parts of the week flash before my eyes. It's become difficult now, because there aren't many new memories being formed in this collective lockdown.

This was a sprint deploy week, so exciting on the product side. i spent a majority of my time ensuring things ran as per plan by bringing alignment in the team. Off late, my main focus has been on cloud security, have been learning & implementing a bunch in this domain. i was reading one of my weekly reports from last March, and was struck by how much we've grown as an engineering team over one year.

i've stopped obsessing over coronavirus news, and if i had to be frank, stopped caring about it. Needed to make this transition to keep myself focussed on my tasks and not get too sidetracked by the feeling of helplessness. They say that "A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic" - i see that becoming real, at least in my mental model for now.

i stuck to my sunset cut-off times for the evening run/workouts almost this entire week - managed to sneak in two short runs, one long run, two bodyweight workouts and one yoga session. Singapore has closed almost every exercise spot in the public parks, but i found a way to do these workouts in a socially distanced manner. Proud of getting after it. 

This Saturday, a couple seniors and i decided to try out a virtually synchronized 10K run - where we started at the same time, and called in on video calls every fifteen minutes! it was a fun experience, the hour-long run didn't feel as long as it usually does, this is something i'll definitely be doing more often in the future. i went out on the usual Kallang-Marina Bay-Kallang route, and weirdly noticed many more runners and cyclists than normal. The lockdown has made rebels out of all of us.

i also did something silly on the gram - decided to jump in on the Roger Federer forehand volley challenge! It was quite a lot of fun to record and share with everyone. Also tried the insane stand-on-your-hands-and-wear-a-tshirt challenge, and obviously couldn't do shit. Earlier today, i made some rice, dal and egg curry for lunch - a marked improvement over dal-chawal from last Sunday. Happy to say that i enjoyed it, i can see myself doing it much more if i had more time.

Just grateful that i'm healthy right now, and as Joe Rogan says, building my immune system to get through this. 

Keep hammerin'
