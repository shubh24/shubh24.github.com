Yes, it is. A process. Everyday. 

We are making progress, and progress is addictive. We take decisions, and we execute. We execute, and we iterate. We iterate, and we progress. 

The days are literally flying by, I'm late on this blog post by two days. Am running short on sleep by a couple hours everyday, trying to get the best version of our product off-ground.

Over the last week, we met more people & iterated towards a clearer prototype. We have started pushing for proof of intent from our potential customers. Worked on a rough draft of market sizing for our product, and demo-ed at the EF stage. Worked on a tech writeup, and super-sexy system diagram. Launched our [website](http://radicali.io), and put out a mockup video of our solution! 

Oh, and before i forget, front-end is a bitch.

On the fitness front, i took it a little easy with the runs this week -- back to routine. Put in one speed run, one regular 5K and an 18K along the park connectors! Have i mentioned before, Singapore is a runner's paradise. 

Took the Saturday off, regained a little headspace & got back on the line soon after. Have managed to sneak in some reading sessions of "The Black Swan" on a couple evenings. Not really proud of how i'm continuing my journalling and meditation habits though, a lot of scope for improvement there.

Okay now, a lot of meetings lined up for tomorrow. Lots of work to be done, later!
