Week 123, another one bites the dust!

This one was heavy on product dev, focussed more on fixing bugs & deploying all servivces. Slowly getting up-to-date with the suite of AWS services! A big issue i faced was that of balancing dev with custoomer demos on an almost everyday basis. We desperately need a demarcation between staging & production!

I'm slowly learning how to modify my pitch based on the kind of customer, and their needs. Intro-ed the product to everyone from legal guys, to compliance noobs! Skipped quite a few practice meetings & pitch-deck writing workshops at EF to focus on the product.

A major part of the weekend turned out to an unintended off-day, as I had to take care of some chores -- buying a new phone one amongst them! What i noticed there was the guilt in me when i'm not working, which is a worrisome sign i feel. I shouldn't feel guilty of taking a couple days off.
 
The morning schedule is still not working out, hopefully i'll get to 6AM mornings by the end of this month. 

We put out the fourth episode of our Early Twenties podcast this weekend, where we'd called upon Aditya for a guest episode! Turned out to be the most-listened-to episode so far, excited about our growth week-over-week!

On the fitness front, i put in all days on the schedule. Felt good with the Abs+Obliques post-run workout, it really stretches my limits! Excited about this week, gonna hit the gym in an hour or so!

Okay folks, later :)
