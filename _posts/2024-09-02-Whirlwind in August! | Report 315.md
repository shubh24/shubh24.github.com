Welcome to 315, it's been six weeks since my last blog and i should recap the whirlwind of August!

Work's been fun, last couple months of figuring-shit-out leading up to a bunch of public launches over the last fortnight. We talked about our focus on AI agents and why we believe agentic interfaces can potentially change user experiences for a ton of workflows.

Although i haven't shipped many blogs of late, but i've been doing a good amount of reflection/journalling in private. Important to do so to think hard about what's truly important for me, dealing with the scearios at hand and charting the best path forward. Feels very much like the brain was holding on to all thoughts and was scared it might forget them, and when i journal those thoughts, the brain feels relieved. The whirlwind in the head quiets down.

i travelled to Europe for the first half of August: worked from Barcelona for a week, and then visited Brussels and Paris with Anukshi! Celebrated her birthday by climbing up the Eiffel, and cruising along the Seine. Such a heartwarming couple weeks, being with someone you truly love takes away all the problems :))

Over the last year or so, i've been visiting European cities and the quality of art everywhere just blows me away. Have been learning about the history of the continent, and it makes me so much more curious to visit all the other empires - now that i have a longer Schengen visa, i'm itching to visit Greece next!

Also stayed with family in Bombay towards the end of August, and spent a good amount of time there locked in because of the rains. i might think a whole lot of travel creates all the whirlwind, but it's actually the thoughts in the mind creating the vortex!

Read a few chapters here & there from a bunch of books: "Thinking in bets", "Conscious Leadership", and "Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance". Trying to incorporate bedtime reading as part of my routine.

Have maintained my body weight at 68.5kgs, but am making a concerted effort to gain 4-5kgs in the last 4 months of the year. Have started calorie tracking again, and feel pretty confident that i'll be hitting my fitness goals. Have done it before, can do it again!

Keep hammerin'
