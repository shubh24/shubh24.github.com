Welcome to May, and welcome to the second biweekly report of 2020. This is 191 & 192.

It's been an intense couple of weeks, where my headspace went to a bunch of different places. On the weekdays, it's mostly work related but the weekends have been good detours into long-term planning - have been talking to more people over calls due to the lockdowns and that's made me process different perspectives. One thing that i've tried to practice is focus on the controllable - this is simple stoic advice, which is very relevant in the current times of unpredictability. There's no point thinking too far ahead if we don't live the present as per plan.

i've been sleeping six-seven hours on weekdays but have been compensating on the weekends - i don't really like this schedule but i've kinda settled into it. i don't see this changing until our overall work schedule shifts.

On the work front, we did a deployment last Friday and i've been pretty much focussed on that for the last two weeks. Have tried to improve our agile planning process recently, but i've realized this is a forever-activity: we can always keep getting better. i did some heavy backend dev myself. i've realized that i'm much more composed when working from home, as the mind is not distracted by commute or any unnecessary interactions from the outside world.

On the fitness front, Week 191 was solid with 3 runs & 3 workouts - however all three of those workouts were very light 15 minute body movements, not pushing my body hard enough. This week was better on the intensity scale, but i skipped Tuesday's bodyweight session as i worked late into the night. Not an excuse - the condition of cooking dinner has brought some discipline in work cut-off times, but i can do better here. Put in two 10K runs over the two weekends, plan to put in a 20K run next weekend. The virtual runs with the team have been quite helpful in keeping boredom at bay during long runs, and are also a good excuse to catch up!

Weekends have been fun with catchup calls, did a two hour chat last weekend which got me thinking about the long term & relationships. Yesterday, i had a chat with a couple seniors after a long time, which felt really good - followed it with a 90 minute online catan session. i feel like these are good habits i should maintain even after lockdowns are lifted and all of us go back to normality.

It's been over a month since i started cooking, my mom reminded me yesterday! It's now a part of the routine and doesn't take as much mental energy now. i've been preparing both lunch & dinner for the last couple weeks - i feel like i should now start experimenting with different cuisines as well. Salads are definitely on the list. i feel like i might not be getting all nutrients required because i'm not consuming any meat - and have been feeling some low energy times during the day as well. Need to fix this.

i've been consuming a good amount of content on YouTube - have been listening to JRE while cooking and recently got hooked to some reaction channels. Not really proud of that. Came across a CGP Grey video on lockdown productivity, which really resonated with me - linking it below for future reference. Elon Musk did Round 2 with Rogan, loved it :)
