Welcome to #228

Post our beta launch, i could take a breather from work but got back on the pedal pretty soon. Work is honestly one thing that takes centerstage in life, and everything revolves around it - if i take days off on weekends, it typically leads to sloppiness in all aspects of life. Goggins doesn't take rest days - i think that is how we should work as well, it is fine to deccelerate when we feel tired, but work(or some meaningful activity) is required to make the day count.

We're currently looking at ways to increase engagement on the product, which is a very interesting problem to solve. This week i focused a portion of my time on backend dev, but also had a bunch of 1-on-1 calls with the team and took some decisions on dev systems to improve efficiency of how we build product. One thing that came up a couple times this week is that bringing complete transparency along with a decentralized chain-of-command(as Jocko says), is much better and quite franky, the opposite of information restriction and micromanagement. i got to stay away from controlling and managing things - let people own, let people lead, let people make mistakes and the team will get better automatically.

Communication is becoming increasingly important in my life - from communicating the right things in the right way to my team, to my co-founder, to my family, to my partner, to my friends. Language is such a funny evolutionary property, weird sounds from our wind pipes now mean so much to us and our emotional beings. Anyhow, i can't be keeping myself away from hard conversations  and the way to get better at it is to force myself to do it every single week, if not for every single day. It's similar to taking a cold shower - it's not necessary and hot water is beautiful and comfortable - but makes me soft and weak. i shouldn't take the easy path out.

On the fitness front, i put in two short runs, one chest/shoulder/tricep workout and four jiujitsu sessions. Felt stronger on the chest - but pretty bummed about not getting my legs and arms workouts for the past two weeks now. i've been following a few folks who are on the `75 hard` challenge where they have to put in two workouts everyday, which is not too hard tbh. If i stay consistent with my schedule, i can also manage three workouts in a week. Learnt a bunch of new techniques in BJJ this week, and also some grappling tricks - although, i'm still the least experienced guy in the group by far! i had put one tennis session a week as one my February goals, but i haven't been achieving that - need to figure a routine for this soon. i'm currently going strong on my NoFap streak, 20 days in.

This weekend was good restoration, as i caught up on reading and headed out to the library to get some new books! i finished `Dollars and Sense` by Ariely and the major learning from this read was to be conscious of my expenses and my rationality behind valuing any commodity/service before purchasing. i read up a bit of `Venture Capital for dummies` for a quick refresher and also started tuning in to more of Sam Harris(now a regular on my Spotify). i also had a good brainstorming session on Sunday morning, and a dinner at my uncle's in the evening. 

Recharged for the week, keep hammerin'
