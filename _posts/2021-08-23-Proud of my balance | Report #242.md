Welcome to #242

"Be free of passions, but full of love" - Marcus Aurelius

Writing this on a Monday morning after getting some sunlight therapy. i've begun morning walks/runs as part of my daily routine and it's a good motivator to maintain consistency. i realized it's been five years since i got placed in college, and went on the Dharamsala trip - time is literally flying away. We are so caught up in the present and the future, that we forget what and where we've come from. Staying in the present coupled with regular lookbacks and introspection should be my strategy.

At work, we continued work on improving our no-code automations and dashboards - and are now close to getting to the 100% user-configurable mark. Listening to user feedback is always heartening, and energizes me. At the same time, it's still the messy middle stage where we are trying to identify the winning formula. It's going to be a hard couple weeks ahead, and i need to keep my chin up sticking to dyfj.

A few protocols i've learnt from Dr. Huberman, and i have to start implementing for maintaining a good routine are as follows:
 - Morning Sunlight within the first hour of waking up
 - Looking far into the horizon for at least 10 minutes a day
 - Look up from the screen every 15-20 minutes, and blink eyes for 15 seconds to counter my dry eyes
 - Breathing exercises(2 inhales, 1 exhale) to get primed for the day
 - Turn off all screens after 10PM. This is the most difficult so far.

i caught a cold last week, and am still recovering from it - the head feels heavy and it's difficult to focus for long stretches. Grateful that it didn't turn to a full-scale fever and i'm able to function on my day-to-day duties. Hopefully i recover fast enough to put in a half-marathon next weekend.

On the fitness front, i put in 2 small runs, 2 gym workouts, 3 BJJ sessions, 1 squash and 1 yoga session this week. At BJJ, we learnt movements with the butterfly hooks from open guard and i had a good bit of learning while sparring this week. i got played around by higher belts like a ragdoll. Had a similar experience with Squash this weekend, where i lost all matches to much more experienced players. it's important to be humbled, and stay a white belt - ego is the enemy.

i haven't been putting any time on working on the finances/investments. Plan to change it up this week by putting in at least 30 minutes on a daily basis.

i have been maintaining the one-week nofap streak, and it has served me good. Currently listening to Huberman's episode on testosterone and estrogen, and they say it is proven that a one-week restraint is good to maintain high T levels. 

This weeekend was restorative, as i spent time with family, friends and alone - the ideal way! Friday night was a get-together as we had dinner and chilled, Saturday was spent in the library where i got myself 8 new books, and Sunday was spent at my uncle's place for Rakshabandhan.

Overall, great times. Keep hammerin'
