Welcome to the blog review on Week One Three Eight!

i started off the week in Bombay, chilling at home and sorting out MTNL issues before taking the long flight back into Singapore. Had a layover in Bengaluru, and i think it has become a universal 'rule' that i meet someone i know at the BLR airport!

It took me some time to get back into my productive flow state, but by Friday afternoon i was churning out good chunks of Python. i've started looking at platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to outsource some parts of our frontend development.

This Friday was quite a blast in terms of socializing -- Entrepreneur First had a space-themed party for the current cohort, where a lot of people eat pizzas, drink beers and celebrate the spirit of EF. Met quite a few interesting folks there, and then headed to a club, which is also the highest point in Singapore -- 1Altitude! Spent a couple hours dancing like my 10-year old self, and nursed my headbanged neck for the next couple of days.

The weekend was super-high on "life", in terms of the work-life balance -- recorded two podcasts & sneaked in a couple hiring calls on Saturday, and then spent the better part of my Sunday running along the East Coast Park. i ran for three and a half hours, in preparation for my first full marathon -- as i wanted to stretch my physical & mental stamin before committing to it. The run wasn't easy, and took my inner reserves of discipline to finish it -- physically, i feel ready for the 42 though :)

As for the podcasts, we are delayed by a couple days on this week's podcast. A very interesting episode with some digital nomads up next week.

PS: This week's report feels very incomplete, because i've not included everything that happened over the week -- will do soon!

Cheers!
