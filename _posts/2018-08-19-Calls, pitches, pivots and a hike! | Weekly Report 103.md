Welcome to Week 103, these days are literally flying away! 

In this episode of the reality show that EF is, we pivoted and pivoted again! Still exploring the B2B Sales space, and feel like we might be onto something real big. Got on a dozen calls, did a couple face-to-faces -- invalidating our ideas constantly.

We tried to zero down on our value prop, still a long way to go! Slowly getting better at communicating our pitch using the Pyramid Principle. Next priority is to reach out to folks in different markets, and finalize on the niche we should be targeting. 

If you know someone in Americas/SE Asia working in B2B Enterprise/mid-market SaaS Sales, connect us :)

I put out a Lanka vlog this Sunday, getting back to my editor feels so good :)

I've been seeing raw human behaviour up close. Fear, insecurity, optimism, confidence, fake confidence, you name it. Its real.

I realized the importance of weekends! Took the Sunday off, and went for a day hike in Singapore's jungles. It was beautiful, will be planning a long run over there soon :) Talking about running, i put in a couple runs this week to the Singapore flyer and back! Haven't been taking out time for journalling, reading or meditation -- would do that if i'd get time to sleep :/

Excuses. Should be cutting off from work earlier in the night. 

Okay lah, later!
