November's here. i've been watching Mike Posner the last few days, and his thought process around life have struck out to me. One of his lines go like,

"I can't keep a girl, no
Cuz as soon as the sun comes up,
i cut 'em all loose, 
and work's my excuse,
the truth is i can't open up.
"

Somehow that line resonates with me, work's my excuse for a lot of things that i don't do. But work's probably the best thing to be doing when i'm twenty-four, and everyone else can go like "Mike, tell us how to make it, we're getting real impatient". Ironic, but that seems like the way to go.

At work, i was completely caught up in a recent deploy we did to roll out annotations on regulations on our platform. i've been waking up in the mornings to get solitary dev time, and those 3-4 hours have been killer. Currently, working on tight timelines for an end-of-November deploy - not much to play around with, managing the product and the team teaches me so much about myself and human behavior everyday.

On many days, i'm sleeping 4-5 hours and that caused some frustration because i couldn't focus completely on other goals. It seems that just working and not worrying about balance is so much more easier, just like how i lived in quarantine. But now, i look forward to going to the gym, socializing, cooking, seeing places - first world problems, but tiring i gotta be honest.

i spent a couple days refreshing `usa election results` on google, to the realization(yet again) on how mindless news cycles are, and how bad our online echo chambers have become. Talked to a few folks who supported Biden, and i leaned more towards Trump this time round - i noticed that i haven't done much thinking for myself and my understanding of the universe comes a lot from the content i consume, Joe Rogan in this particular case. Back in 2016, i didn't understand the Republican POV, and this time round i didn't understand the Democrat POV - we're all being played by media houses in a game show and there doesn't seem to be an exit button.

On the fitness front, i haven't been going after the marathon prep goals that i had set out. However, i still managed to get my workouts in - albeit shorter than they should be. Getting some is more important than getting nothing. i'm currently at 63.5KG, and i should aim to get into the high sixties by pulling down my fat percentage. i have been steadily increasing the weights i lift, need to switch it up further. Nutrition's not great - didn't feel good on this Sunday's afternoon run. i'm not getting a proper lunch many days because i'm stuck in front of my screen in the afternoon - not something i'm proud of.

Talking about balance, the weekends have been a lot of fun recently. With a bunch of friends, i cycled around ECP and jumped into the water on a beautiful moonlit night. Visited the top of Marina Bay with my date, and dropped her off to the airport(and saw Jewel Changi!) earlier today as she left for Bombay. Visited Arab Street earlier in the week, felt a little weird as we move towards a long-distance affair for the near term future. It's probably a good test to see how we take this forward, and also a reminder for me on how to stay happy & peaceful with myself. Not too long ago, i was on the nofap journey - it's funny how life changes. i escape my emotions with immersing myself with work, convincing myself it's productive - that's what Mike Posner also said.

Life's beautiful. Keep hammerin'
