Welcome to Week 177. Writing this on a Sunday afternoon, it's Republic Day back in India & Chinese New Year being celebrated here in SG!

Another 7-day workweek - to be honest, it doesn't feel like work anymore. It's just something i'm supposed to do. We kicked off the second sprint, and went heavy on planning & UI design this time round before diving into code. Asynchronously, i've been involved in setting up Gitlab CI/CD for our team & have also started experimenting with K8S - good learnings. Took a bunch of hiring interviews, and re-realized that management ain't easy. 

One notable observation from this week is that i've been functioning on 6 hours of sleep on average - not because of work, but a bad evening routine. Put in two night runs & two night workouts, which pump me up to the point that i can't sleep till at least 2 hours later. However, the good thing is that it hasn't affected my work productivity, i feel as active which makes me question whether the 8-hour theory is just theory. On the other hand, i could see myself getting irritated on petty inconveniences - which is mostlikely a consequence of lack of sleep. i need to find a balance. 

Observing the self is a superpower though - i've started to force myself to listen to podcasts of people that i don't agree with. It makes me question every belief that i held beforehand, and why. The mind is easily moulded, it's important to keep giving it conflicting thoughts to play with - especially when it comes to things like ethics, politics, life.

On the fitness front, i've put in 2 runs, 2 workouts & 1 tennis session(at NUS, boy they have a lot of courts!) so far. Same result as last week, lagging behind by 1 run & 1 workout. The variability caused by the tennis sessions is messing up the routine, i need to fix it. However, playing tennis is the most fun, i'd do it more if i could. 

Have been listening to Eminem the whole of week, offsetting it by some Selena Gomez now. Need to get a haircut now, and then get back to work. Sunday week planning sessions are the best!

Keep hammerin'
