My weekly report - from the 25th of July to the 31st of July. Some of the more enjoyable days I've had in recent times!

I left Bangalore Monday evening, but the delayed flight meant about 5 hours of airport productivity. Wrote a [travel blog](https://shubh24.github.io/travel/2016/07/25/nandi-hills-bengalurus-favourite-weekend-escapade), worked on Birbal and Casey Neistat-ed the rest of the time!

I was booked for 2 days and 3 nights in Bombay -- at my home. Spent some quality family time and played Pokemon Go for the first time -- Productivity took an expected dip. 

By the time I left for my flight to Jaipur, I could sense a definite haze with regards to Location and Time! Coming to Pilani is one of the more blissful things in life, it just feels good. I got settled into my room by Tuesday evening, and spent the rest of the day just catching up with friends.

For the past 3 days, I've been working on a [Data Science Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/zscontest/challenges/predict-annual-revenue/) by ZS Associates. I didn't rank very well in the competition, but I came out learning a lot! Expect a technical blog on my approach towards the problem and how I went about learning about the domain. Work on Birbal has been brought to a closure, with regards to a Hackathon submission. Since we'll be busy with the upcoming Placement Season, it might turn out to be difficult to concentrate on both simultaneously.  

[Prabhjyot](https://github.com/psdh) has brought a skateboard (thanks to our Casey Neistat fever), which has been my obsession ever since. I've reached a decent level, but need to practice a lot! Just ordered one from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.in/dp/B00I2NE5QC/ref=pe_386221_143748981_TE_item)! Also intend to improve on my fitness regime and a non-nocturnal routine from this week. 

I need to catch some sleep now -- Registrations tomorrow. That's it folks!
