Week 116-117. Feels crazy as i write this number! 

We have been going full throttle on developing the backend for our MVP, alternating between features on the daily. Have been working well with Gyani, and that has helped push my productivity to more than 2x! 

We had to take a bunch of tough decisions on prioritization, all with the goal of getting maximum product feedback with minimum effort. Should be building out a community collaboration platform, should we be building our MVP on Airtable, should we build out the frontend or the NLP first. Tough questions.

Even tougher is building structure & cadence b/w non-tech & tech efforts. Getting better, one feature at a time :)

We are currently working on building an intuitive UX for the platform, which will inform the frontend efforts. Have been prototyping on UI mockup tools & Airtable, but we have been going back to the drawing board again & again. 

With EF, we have been working on our investor deck -- over the past 2 weeks, we built on our Problem/Solution & Go-to-Market/Market Size modules. Every slide has so much backstory to it, so many iterations! 

I get overwhelmed at times just by thinking about the product, which isn't super-healthy in the long term. For the last week, i've tried to switch off on the weekends and do more "normal people" stuff XD

`Being busy is an option` 

I didn't put out last week's blog post, by convincing myself that i'm too busy in my subconscious. I need to stop bullshitting myself -- these blogs can't take a backseat. Not now.

On the fitness front, i have just been killing it. i ran a 24KM last weekend, and a 5:09 10K this weekend! With my gym sessions, i have been regretting that i didn't start earlier -- sign of a positive habit built :) 

Okay, it's 3 in the AM. Big meet tomorrow, later :)
