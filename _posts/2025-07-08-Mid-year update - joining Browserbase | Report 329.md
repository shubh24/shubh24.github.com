Report #329, 7th of July. Writing this mid-flight to Hawaii!

After a one-week break traveling in New Mexico and relaxing in San Francisco, I was raring to get back into work mode.

Last week, I joined Browserbase and it‚Äôs been so much fun! I thought long and hard about what‚Äôs the right space/vector for me to be working in, and spoke to a bunch of different companies across the stack. Investing in infra and building my specific knowledge in this niche makes most sense - coupled with the fact that infra serving the AI internet is a market that is going to crush in the years to come. I would be working in a Sales Engineering role at Browserbase, where I‚Äôd be involved in pre-sales as well as post-sales motions - giving me the right platform to build  my intuition into AI/automation use cases as I work with the customers.

It‚Äôs been just one week, and I‚Äôm now witnessing what true PMF looks like. When you just can‚Äôt keep up with the demand. When the product sells itself. So much to do, beyond excited!

Earlier this week, I was surprised by Divyansh and my whole ex-Houseware team as they tricked me to walk into a zoom call! So grateful to have worked with my team over the last few years, and have built such strong relationships with each one of them. The team also gifted me Meta Ray-bans and they‚Äôve become my daily driver now, it‚Äôs such a cool piece of technology!

It was the 4th of July weekend, Anukshi & I packed our bags and headed to Yosemite! It is such a beautiful place, and you‚Äôre awestruck when you‚Äôre standing in the middle of all those granite peaks. We hiked up the mist trail, upto Nevada falls and also did a bunch of other trails nearby. Very peaceful weekend - when I go on long hikes like these, my mind goes blank which is rare these days, and probably very important too! More importantly, Anukshi and I spent some real quality time together on the trip and experiences like these make me realize how lucky I am to have found her :))

On the fitness front, I didn‚Äôt make any movement as I was figuring my routine with the new job. So no workouts/runs except for the long hike on Saturday. Surprisingly, I‚Äôve maintained my body weight at 70kg, and that‚Äôs good.

On the flight to Hawaii right now for Browserbase‚Äôs offsite! Intend to use this time to get to know the team better, and of course,  enjoy the beaches!

Keep hammerin‚Äô
