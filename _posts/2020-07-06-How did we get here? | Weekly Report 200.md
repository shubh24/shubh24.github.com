Welcome to 200! Oh, how long have i been waiting to write this :)

Still can't believe it's been two hundred weeks since i started this habit, everytime i hit a round number on the blog reports, i tend to revisit my Google Photos library and then get sucked into the old times. Writing this on a Monday night, have a lot to do - so let's get this done with quick.

^^This is how my room looked like when i set it up for the first time in July '17 - feels so weird. The same whiteboard is still on my wall :)

Wonder where i can get to if i keep this going. Two thousand maybe, twentyfive hundred if we're lucky. It'll be insane to have a library of my last fifty years online.

Anyway, one thing that i've realized off late is that external words affect my thinking & speech greatly. And it's not just me, this happens with everyone - i've noticed this in meetings where taking the lead with certain phrases can steer the conversation towards where i want. If controlling thoughts is as easy, it raises the question how much of what we think as free will actually is. Also makes me question all the crap that i consume online, and how i need to read quality thoughts/books before important conversations.

It was a solid week at work, where we did a bunch of trial review meetings with users and wrapped up the ongoing sprint on Friday. i'm feeling a little too stretched by all the demands from different teams, and hence need to design better systems for product dev - we're starting with PRDs now, and will evaluate if that eases the number of adhoc meetings that i have to attend to.

We did a team lunch mid-week, i've been missing my salads for a while now! i've not been sleeping well enough during the week - pulled in consecutive days with only 3-4 hours in the bank. Pulled a 6:30AM morning on Friday and got myself three super-productive hours before work actually began! Trying to get the sleep cycle in order this week, fingers crossd. 

Continuing on the thread of consuming crap online, i've been thinking about going on a nofap experiment for a while now. Have been watching a few videos about the effects of porn on the mind, and i feel quite convinced. Discipline will be called for, i'll update more about my results here.

On the fitness front, i put in all the sessions: 3 runs, 2 gym days, 1 home workout(leg) and 3 foam-roll sessions. My left knee is giving me some troubles, i'm gonna take it easy for the next week or so. The weekend was very well-balanced, as i went on a slow long run with a bunch of friends along Marina Bay, walked till Clarke Quay, and then ran back via Bencoolen. Half of my Sunday was spent hanging with two flatmates that moved in to my house, and the rest of it planning for the week. 

Goals for July: After Joe Rogan's insistence, i plan to develop a kettlebell routine at the gym. i will learn how to cook fish, and get better at my chicken meals. Lots to do. Gotta get my Monday run in now. Keep hammerin'
