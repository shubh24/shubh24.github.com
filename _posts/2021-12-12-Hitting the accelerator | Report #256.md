Welcome to 256!

When i'm not in the best of moods, i think of whether i'd feel the same when my father or mother passes away. It puts my anger or disappointment in perspective, and makes me kick myself for not talking to them enough. Time is running out.

At work, things had started off slow as i'd returned from Goa on Monday morning, but things got to a beautiful pace by Friday night. Pushing code has a weird sense of feedback loop with my well-being, doing it often and well makes me happy. Exciting things happening at work, pushing me to hit the pedal to the floor for the next couple weeks. Learnt a new term recently called 'workafrolic' - this might enter my bio soon :))

i've been auditing my communications and thinking about how i interface with the world, putting much more energy in this than i would usually do. Learning and growing everyday - as Mr.Fridman put it recently, "Nobody in this world can tell me what to think, but I think everybody has a lesson to teach me."

My home-cooked meals need to be planned better - i've been facing afternoon energy crashes off late. Otherwise, getting better with nutrition as i've been making myself some heavy breakfasts after working out. Eating is fun!

On the fitness front, i put in two runs, two gym workouts, 1 yoga, 1 BJJ and 1 tennis sesh! Feeling good with how the body is responding, i need to ramp up on the BJJ classes and make it muscle memory. i've been biking around to anywhere under 8 kilometers from home, and i just treat it as cardio bonus! i'm currently on Day 5 of NoFap, being busy with work and exercise always helps. 

i spent the weekend majorly outside of home, spending Saturday morning at the BJJ gym and evening at VKB's birthday party. i hit Cubbon Park for a Sunday morning run with a friend, headed out for lunch with another friend, and currently typing this out before scooting to the evening tennis session! Need to kickstart the routine around meeting/zooming with my network. If i sit in a restaraunt and spend time observing people, it becomes clear how there's a different movie reel running in everyone's head - people are so obsessed with their reality, while the entire fabric of reality seems unimaginable.

Keep hammerin'
