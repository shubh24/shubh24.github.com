My weekly report from the 11th of September to the 17th of September -- A jam-packed week, as i pushed myself at work, spent three nights editing and the weekend in Pune-Satara! 

*You don't realize it's every second. Always. Forever. -- Gary Vaynerchuk*

At work, we mapped out a month-long plan on going ahead with the first cut of segsort. This will help me in learning the process of a production-ready project from scratch! Currently, experimenting and testing out ideas on product and user segmentation, based on price-based features. The pace is good, plan to push it up in the coming days.

Spent a couple weeknights working on the *Web Traffic Forecasting* blog, still not in the groove. Should push it out by tonight. I'm also planning to take up on the Zillow challenge on kaggle, should get started sometime this week :) New challenge, yay!

The *Weekly Uploads* project is seriously time-consuming, but its a lot of fun tbh! I feel some of my edits in this week's vlog were pretty good improvements, getting better!

Gotta sit on the Satara vlog edit this week. Have an idea for the next vlog -- a documentary on Cubbon Park, will pen its script soon!

I spent the weekend in Pune and Satara, another of those beautiful solo trips! Ran the 21 km hill marathon in 01:57:55, a hill champion! However good i might feel about my timing, i seriously felt both demotivated and inspired at certain stretches of the route. A lady, easily double my age was easily jogging along with me till the 17km mark. Here i am, putting in the work, week in week out, and a woman double my age is kicking my ass! Seeing the Ethiopian athletes sprinting the entire 21km makes me question my efforts, it makes me reconsider my goals. Gonna be fitter, faster, stronger. No excuses.

That's it! Later
