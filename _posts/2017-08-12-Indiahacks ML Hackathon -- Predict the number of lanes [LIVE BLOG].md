Welcome to my live blog -- My attempts at cracking into the Indiahacks ML hackathon. This is the second round(zonals), and there are around 50 of us participating across India, only 15 will qualify for the finals. An exciting 20 hours to follow :)

**August 12, 13:56** Almost an hour into the hackathon, i've had a brief look at the dataset, i have a rough idea of whats to follow. The problem is around predicting the number of road lanes, basis satellite data of lane lines, coordinates etc. Will dive into exploration for the next couple of hours, but first i'll catch up on some lunch ;)
