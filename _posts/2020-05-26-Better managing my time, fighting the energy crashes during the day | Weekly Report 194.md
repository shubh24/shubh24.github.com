Welcome to a delayed upload of Report 194.

Was an intense-as-usual week at work as we pushed for our sprint deploy on Friday, and some work had to be taken care of over the weekend. Pulling off deploys is always rich with dopamine, but i've learnt to calm myself down and see the larger picture to compare the current state of the product versus where it needs to be. Otherwise, the external calls have reduced by a fair amount and i can put more of my bandwidth into engineering.

i've recently realized that my sense of intuition is not that great. A lot of activities i do and beliefs i hold today were rejected by my older self when i came across them - sticking to peer pressure or advice from others or random chance has brought me where i am. Need to get better at thinking about the long term, and i need to get better at opening myself to new perspectives of working and living.

Last week, i'd blogged about hitting reset and getting Vitamin D - the routine is a little better but i'm still not getting any sunlight. Writing this blog on a late Monday night after sleeping only 5 hours the previous night. This sleep debt keeps accumulating and then hits hard on the weekend. i need to get better at managing my mornings, definitely need a routine. i'm noticing afternoon energy crashes and midnight energy spikes - this follows from the current cycle of working late into the night. All kinds of problems to take care of!

Singapore is planning to reopen the economy, but it doesn't have any direct impact on my day-to-day at least. we'll still be working from home for the near future, as far as i can see. Crying about these problems is stupid, i was talking to my grandfather this Saturday and realized how wound up i am in my own life. The only time i'm even slightly grateful is after i finish my runs, and feel happy that i can run - other than that, i'm pretty much taking everything for granted. If anything, this pandemic might teach me some empathy. Not sure when the arrogance leaves the teenage mind.

On the fitness front, i put in the three runs(although the schedule was all messed up) and 2 core workouts. Missed the upper body workout, but managed to sneak in my foam-roller session on Sunday. One thing that i might struggle with is getting back to the same strength in the upper body, because i've not been focusing on it enough in my bodyweight workouts. 

Talked a lot to friends and family on Saturday evening, made me happy. Should keep this going. Keep hammerin'
