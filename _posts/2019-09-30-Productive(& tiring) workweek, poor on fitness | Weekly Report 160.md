Welcome to Report #160 -- writing a regular weekly report after so long!

The last week was super productive, as i put in long days at work - was fulfilling seeing plans getting turned into work. A lot of my time nowadays is spent in doing catch-ups, making plans, tracking progress, and thinking about design level decisions. We also made some exciting progress on our NLP models, as we played around with GPUs and thought about tradeoffs b/w accuracy & speed. It gets tiring, but is a lot of fun. 

This week was particularly disappointing on the fitness front because i didn't put in any workouts except a 10K on Sunday night. Once i hit the dry patch, it gets very difficult to hit reset during the week & bounce back. i hadn't run in 14 days, inertia works both ways. 

i was struggling to get up early enough in the mornings, and was watching quite a bit of YouTube in the nights - the unspent energy has to go somewhere, and that led to late night video binges. This is very unsettling, it hasn't happened to me in close to a year. To get back on track, i have registered myself for the Singapore StanChart Full Marathon on 30th November this year. Just 60 days to go, full steam ahead!

September is coming to an end - it was quite an eventful month overall, and helped me gain some more perspective on the kind of work i'm doing. The Bengaluru trip was good, i tried to meet up with as many people as possible - it was possibly one of the more tiring & social weeks in the last year or so. i lagged behind on the meditation & journalling sessions this month(accounting to less than 10, for both). My wake-up times have been consistent over the weekdays, now i get up b/w 8 and 8:30 on an average day.

This weekend was a rather easy one, i took Saturday off to do some shopping/chores. Went out on the Sunday evening run, and worked for a while in the second half. Also caught up on a couple Tim Ferris episodes, and one with Joe Rogan - really getting back into the podcast game since the last week! All in all, well rested - all set for the week!

Keep hammerin'
