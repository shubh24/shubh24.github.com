On this 7-day episode of my life, i'll take you through Week 105 -- a week of exploring new problems in a new team!

This Monday, i teamed up again(!) and am working on problems in the RegTech space. Helping make the lives of compliance officers better, we're still in the phase of exploring pain points and validating our solutions. There are meetings every day, progress to be made every day. 

On the fitness front, i wasn't feeling it in my runs lately, i felt like i wasn't pushing myself. i took up this completely nonsensical goal to go on a run, everyday -- for a week at least. i went crazy. Clocked 40 kilometres overall, just a couple short of a full-marathon! 

Sneaking in a run inside your routine can be tough. But when you get your priorities straight, it isn't that hard. You just have to RUN.

Have been getting back into a good morning and evening routine slowly, progress made at work translates into progress made on self. I have restarted my journalling habit, getting there one day at a time. I'm back on the TimFerris/Jocko Willink podcasts -- tuned into one with Drew Houston, one with Brian Chesky and more! 

Guess that's that, no vlogs as of now. See ya next week :)
