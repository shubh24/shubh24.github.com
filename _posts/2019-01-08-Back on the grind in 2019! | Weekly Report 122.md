The week from 29th of Dec 2018 to 6th of Jan 2019. Heavy on travelling, reflection and gratefulness.

I was in Bombay on New Years' eve. I had pushed out my yearly blog report a couple of days earlier, but deep down i felt that i could have done better with the blog. Next year! Celebrated the new year with family friends, and took an early morning flight to Bangalore on the 1st. 

Met up with a couple friends over lunch, and then headed back for another flight to Singapore! The Bangalore trip put me in a reflective zone as to where i was six months back & how much has changed since then. Time travelled inside my head, as i crashed at my bed by the morning of the 2nd.

It took me some time to get back on the grind, but happy that i'm there now. Mapped out mini-goals for January, and focussed on deploying our microservices over the rest of the week -- devops is a bitch! Back on working on traction, but the next couple weeks will be heavy on pitch-writing & presentation in prep for the Demo Day. At EF, we did a group pitch session to give feedback on our peers' pitches. 

A quick report on the new years resolutions: The early mornings ain't working so far, and will require an insane amount of will power from my side. I'll get there. 

I've got a couple books for the next two months -- "The Art of Thinking Clearly" & "Sapiens", they've been on my list for quite some time now. For January, "Art of Thinking Clearly" is gonnna become my go-to.

Over the weekend, we put out our third episode of the "Early Twenties" podcast -- talked about Execution, on how we go about building habits and avoiding pitfalls.

On the fitness front, i put in all my sessions except the travel day. Feeling pretty good with the efforts on the long run -- ran a 28K along the ECP this Saturday. The full marathon doesn't look out of reach anymore! In the new year, i'm gonna double down on my core(lower abs+obliques) workouts.

Okay folks, later la!
