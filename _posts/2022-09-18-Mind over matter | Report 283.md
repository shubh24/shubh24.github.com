Welcome to 283, a two-week report from 5th September to 18th September. Currently listening to Em killing MGK, never gets old!

Work's bene intense for the last couple weeks with the first one being wfh-heavy. i've been heads down in execution mode, but also enjoying the process of bringing the team together on crucial milestones. Standups, meetings & demos -- all of these are opportunities to guide the team towards the right outcomes. Did a surprise demo last Friday, which is always fun!

i've not been reading or consuming as i'd planned a few weeks ago. Many a times, work and the task list take precedence, pushing this off the stack -- the only way to get better is to get a better handle on my morning routine and carve out that 30 minutes for myself. 

This weekend, i headed out for my first time in a cold plunge. The water was somewhere between 5-8 degrees celsius and it wasn't as hard as i'd imagined it to be! i went in for a couple rounds - totalling close to 3 minutes. Whenever i would look away, shivers would run through me and when i closed my eyes to focus on the breath, i was able to control my response much better. Also tried out the Wim Hof breathing exercise, and had some fun observations about the technique. The breath hold for 2 minutes is very similar to the last few seconds for a strangle choke in BJJ, and you know exactly when to pull the plug! In any case, the cold plunge is all about keeping mind over matter - will be doing more of this in the future!

Had great conversations with Anukshi around how we can better handle stressful situations for each other. Lost my temper for about 3 seconds during a conversation, and i'm not happy about it. Realized that i've been compartmentalizing life a little too much and need to let go of this work-life distinction -- i can be freer, i can be easier on myself, i can face my thoughts better, i can share more. 

Bought myself an Ather 450X for commutes in the city, and it's so much better not having to be subject to the driving experience of the horrible auto/cab rides. Makes life convenient, and the scooter always gets me excited about loading Google Maps on the scooter screen - how cool is that! Met a bunch of Singapore folks over the last couple weekends in Kora, caught up on life and had good food, what more do we need?

Keep hammering.
